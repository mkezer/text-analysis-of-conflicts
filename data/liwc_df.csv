An apartment that talaya and I had really liked from the beginning Allie was not comfortable paying for, which was totally fine and I was happy to compromise. As time went on it was becoming more and more stressful because prices were about to go up. One morning, Allie called me before I had class and said that she just called to other apartments we were looking at and said that they had no availability left so we had to sign a lease with this apartment (apartment #1) as soon as possible. Not knowing what to do, we all submitted applications online so we could get a lease agreement sent to us. Later I called my mom to tell her what was going on because i hadn't had time earlier since it was all happening so fast. She told me she didn't want me living there because my older brother had in the past and did not have a good experience. Then, talaya calls the other apartment we were looking at to find out that they actually did have available floor plans, so we were both confused why allie had heard otherwise. I called her and asked if we could all meet that night to talk things over. I explained the situation and why i was reluctant to live there and she said she doesnt think her parents would pay for apartment #2 ($80 more a month) even though earlier they had agreed to pay for a more expensive one. I hated telling her that I didn't want to live there and I was crying because I felt so horrible.

A small dorm room with almost zero personal space doesn't need the added clutter of dirty clothes and old dished lying about. But each time I confronted her about the mess or asked her to clean her side of the room I was suddenly being unreasonable for wanting a clean living space. This has spurred countless arguments. Particularly about her things encroaching onto my side of the room. If she simply cleaned her side of the room she would have plenty of space for her things to go that doesn't overflow onto my area.

As the years went on, we had conflicts come up between the two of us. The types of people that we both were differed, and it led to misunderstandings. She would often accuse me of not caring enough about her, saying that I was a bad friend. She drew these conclusions from the fact that I tended to be an independent person, and I preferred to have time to myself. When she saw me opting out of going to lunch with her, walking home with her, etc, she took it to mean that I didn't like her. This tension between the two of us grew, and eventually it reached a boiling point in our junior year. One day, after having not spoken to each other for a little while, she decided to confront me. She accused me not only of being a bad friend, but also a bad person. I didn't take kindly to this, because I felt wrongly accused as a result of her overblown emotional reaction. When I tried to calmly reason with her, she remained stubborn. She even started to try and side our mutual friends with her. The drama that resulted from this dispute affected more than my relationship with her, but that with others in my life as well.

Over a period of time prior to this point, rumors have circulated about previously close friends of mine talking bad about myself, my body, and how anyone that becomes friends with me seem to adapt to my similar body shape. Naturally, this hurt me and even more so made me angry, especially because even more gossip has been spread about me from people I used to consider close friends. During a time of lowered inhibitions, I told some people about the rumor one specific guy said about my body and friends, following with me crying for the rest of the night. The following day, I received a giant text from said person, accusing me of ""tarnishing"" his reputation and how he has never done anything to hurt me, essentially telling me to stop talking to/about him and his friends. Of course, my natural reaction was to argue while also trying to make peace. Ultimately, I failed. Our shared close friends ended up caught in the crossfire, as this guy went on a mission trying to figure out who told me the rumor I shared, and unfortunately, their friendships were tarnished and I was blamed by the same group of guys who started the rumor. Tension and persistent shit-talking continued for the rest of the school year. I was able to be civil and mature whenever talking to this guy and his friends in person, but there was always a mutual feeling of dislike towards one another.

My partner and I had become irritated with the behavior of someone in our friend group, who we'll call M. M is not great at following through on promises when they say they will. Often, they will say they are about to send a letter, but two or three days later they'll chime in with the same promise - having still not sent the letter yet. It should be noted that with one or two exceptions, everyone in our friend group has ADHD/ADD, so it was an understandable problem to have, but it became a larger issue when we had to delay a group activity we were organizing. A gift exchange took an extra week because M was slow to mail their gift (for clarity's sake, this wasn't on the post office; M waited until the last second to mail the package), and my partner and I felt it was unfair to everyone else, because we'd all made time and moved our schedules so we could open the gifts together. I have this priority about punctuality and trust: if someone tells me they will mail a letter and then they don't, I will begin to trust them less, especially if they make the same promise to me over and over without following through. I might start to trust them less with regards to other promises.



It felt like M wasn't aware of how their actions were affecting the group. They didn't publicly show any self-awareness of their issues with time management. My partner and I were hurt and impatient. We reached out to M with no intention of cruelty, but with discernable irritation, and because M was already having an awful day, we pushed them into a meltdown.

She was so quick to judge and make hurtful questions, like we can all do at times, but I couldn't believe what I had just heard from her mouth.

I also could not get over how she called them aliens. They are people and no human being, regardless of citizenship status, should be labeled as illegal or an alien. That is dehumanizing. Their value goes so much farther beyond their citizenship status. This is aside form the blatant racism when she assumed that they were illegal because they weren't white. That is not how you should be treating others. I try my best to love others and avoid any kind of judgment regardless of their actions, race, sexuality, or preferred gender.

It started out by them asking me to let them have the room to themselves for a little while because they’re introverted and need alone time. I thought this was a little weird, but agreed nonetheless because I didn’t want to create a bigger issue. Over time, they asked for increasingly more alone time, and would sometimes ask me to leave at night. This made me uncomfortable and I didn’t want to leave the room, but I didn’t want to stay in with a person who didn’t want me to be there. I adapted my behavior to spend as little time in the room as possible, which my ex-roommate proceeded to complain about. This made me very confused and frustrated because I didn’t want to be in a place I was frequently kicked out of, and it made me feel like I was not a person with my own personal needs, but an object that can be stored away and taken out when the user chooses. The tension and frustration began to build up until one night when I was kicked out yet again, I left in a passive-aggressive way that my ex-roommate later confronted me about.

1a,929,control,"This requires a little backstory. I was probably around 18 at the time, and I was in an abusive relationship with this nasty guy I'd been stuck dating since I was 16. I hated him, but escaping an abusive relationship isn't as easy as people who haven't experienced one make it sound. (I got out shortly after this and  I'm fine now, don't worry). Moral of the story, this guy sucks and is a horrible person with nasty hot-head tendencies. Anyways, I remember we got into one of our routine fights, but this one was more severe. My memory is foggy from this time in my life, but I remember he insulted his mother somehow, and this enraged me. My mom isn't around, so anytime I hear someone insult theirs, I get sensitive. His mom was a single mother who raised 4 boys on her own, and she devoted her life to these kids. Whatever he said was offensive and completely uncalled for, and it made me upset. After all she had done for him over the years, this is how he's going to treat her? Not on my watch. This wasn't the first time he had insulted his mom, so I finally said something in her defense. This guy didn't like being called out on anything, so we started yelling at each other about the conflict. I would defend her, he would insult her and me, back and forth words were thrown. Things escalated and we probably started yelling about unrelated, unresolved conflicts in the process. I don't remember what was said, but it was a nasty fight. He ends up punching a hole in the living room wall, then storming out onto the front lawn. This display of aggression only made me more mad. Like what is punching a hole in the wall going to do? At this point, we're still screaming at each other on the front lawn, I'm surprised the cops weren't called. I was worried about my safety, knew things weren't going to get resolved, so I just hopped in my car and left. He stormed back inside and broke the front door's screen door off the hinges in the process as I drove off.

I was in charge of the performing team because the previous leader drew out half-way. It was a sudden incident so I had a rough time catching up with what I had to do. It was hard to communicate with all members and because everybody was busy with finals. Therefore, I was called out by the program's leaders, and there were a few misunderstandings as everything was rather new to me. I tried to solve the issues by, first of all, figuring out the best way to encourage members to practice on their own, then arrange time slots so they can meet up and correct each other. I also reached out to the leaders, apologizing for the messy situation, and asked for their specific explanations on tasks I should do. I also stated my opinions on some issues, trying to encourage the most effective ways to carry out this program, as things were tough on all of us and there was frustration from many members from not understanding the leaders.

Looking back at this conflict, it all seems ridiculous, but it was very stereotypical high school drama. I had met this girl during sophomore year in one of my classes and we became friends, mostly because we had half of our classes together and thought it would be nice to have another person to reach out to if we ever needed help in the class. The friendship was doing fine for the rest of that year, and I even tried out for the dance team because she was on the team and really enjoyed it, plus I love dancing. I ended up making the team and started improving, as one does with practice, and was put in spots during performances that were ""better"" than the spots my friend was in. I also started to become friends with one of the co-captains and the secretary of the team, which was because I went to the same middle school as one of them and we had a lot in common. I made the team again senior year, and I even became secretary of the team. This girl that I had befriended sophomore year had also run for the secretary spot, but she did not get it. That same day, she left practice early because she was so upset about losing, and she started to shut me out. She had eventually quit the team a few months into the school year, and I had found out she was angry with me for getting that spot on the team. This was not exactly news to me, even during junior year I was able to see that she would get upset whenever I was doing well. This whole conflict even got to the point where she went to the principle to try and get the dance team coach in trouble for not treating everyone the same way on the team. She did not even try to talk with me or my coach about it, she just went straight to the principle to try and get people in trouble.

My issue came from her whining, general lack of kindness as well as basic knowledge, and a lack of human decency. She would complain about things and get really defensive about others, claiming that no one would understand her situation. For example, she is adopted and got really defensive about people having children young. I tried to talk to her as someone who is also adopted but she said ""I don't want to hear it"". It was incredibly demeaning and insulting. She is not my favorite person and she would consistently avoid doing work while making others do it for her. Rather than make her do what everyone else in the class was doing, such as moving to another table for group work, teachers would accommodate her and not punish her for bad behavior. Others had been punished for less. She is infuriating and obviously I have a lot to say.

1a,165,pt,"I had a conflict with someone in my sociology class over hegemonic masculinity and the “myth of the pickup.” During our discussion section: most of the class was in consensus regarding the theory: that when men go to bars to try and pick up women: they’re not preforming with the goal of actually picking up a woman or being successful: but actually preforming for their fellow males. This homosocial performance, as stated in lecture, is most successful when the man is able to act dominant and objectify women with his peers. If the peers don’t observe the behavior: the whole action becomes obsolete. My classmate during the discussion on this theory disagreed: stating that men are oppressed to think that the only way they could get the girl is by acting in this certain dominant manner: and that their friends were just kindly trying to help.

The conflict was that my girlfriend had been distant and I had asked her a handful of times over a long period (maybe 6 months) what was going on, each time being very understanding and gentle. Everytime we talked about it she did not know how she felt, she just knew she had felt off. I think she was feeling self conscious with her personality because she was having a hard time making new friends and I also think she had some body image issues that may have been affecting our relationship as well. From my end, I felt I may have resorted to over compensating for her lack of being there by trying to talk all the time or by getting her things, basically just being too much in general. She would tell me it wasn't that but she still did not know how she felt. Eventually after these 6 months or so she broke down one day telling me she didn't feel good about our relationship and again I asked her how come and she did not know, she just knew she was feeling wrong about it and that she was ""losing interest"".

While also, we both at the time were underage to even be drinking. Buddy was mentally probably fine. He had two beers over the span of four hours, but still there was no need to take such a risk. We argued and I said fine, i am not getting in the car, i will take an uber. We both ended up taking an uber home. It was a silent drive home.

1a,226,pt,"Once I had a conflict with my mother when she walked in on me going to the bathroom. Out family usually doesn’t close the bathroom door all the way and my mother did not know I was home yet. The bathroom light was on and the door was nearly closed, so I was mad at my mother for ignoring the signs that someone was in the bathroom and disturbing me in the middle of something private. I sternly said to close the door. She closed the door, but then she started yelling at me because I had not closed the door all the way and had not announced my presence to her when I came home from school. I think my mother just felt embarrassed and a little stupid, so she tried to deflect her feelings and take them out on me in the meat of the moment. I think my mother felt bad about yelling at me while I was just doing my business in the normal family manner; however, she never apologized. This leads me to believe that she felt so embarrassed that she was never able to admit to herself that the incidence could possibly have been her fault. For the most part, I believe my mother was not thinking very hard when she entered the bathroom, as she is often on autopilot. I bet now she will remember to look for signs and turn on her brain before she enters a closed bathroom door with the light already on because she probably does not want to be embarrassed again.",263,41.32,40.99,95.49,1,26.3,15.21,96.58,63.12,19.01,16.35,9.51,0,0,6.46,0.38,2.66,8.37,13.69,7.98,7.98,7.6,3.04,17.87,2.66,1.52,1.14,0.38,1.52,4.18,0,4.18,1.52,1.52,0,12.93,3.04,0,8.75,0,14.07,4.56,1.14,0.76,3.42,1.52,2.66,4.18,1.14,1.14,1.9,0.76,0.38,0,0,0.38,3.8,0.76,1.14,0.76,0.76,0.76,9.13,6.46,1.14,21.67,2.66,12.17,6.84,1.14,3.04,6.08,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.84,3.8,2.28,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,0
1a,228,pt,A conflict that I have had with another person is that my sister wanted me to drive her to school while I preferred to go alone and that she take the bus. I did not want to take her because I wanted to listen to my music without having to be attacked by my sister and I also just wanted piece before the school day. Im sure she felt annoyed because taking the bus is never better than getting a ride to school. Cars are more comfortable and you do not have to deal with other people screaming or whatever. I am sure it was frustrating not being able to drive yourself to school as I dealt with the years prior when I did not have a license so I am sure she thought if only she had a license. I guess she probably also wondered why I would not take her because in her mind she is not annoying but to me very. She probably also did not agree with my choice. She probably did not care too much though as it was a small part of the day and she would have the whole day to forget about it.,201,11.5,14.8,19.87,34.4,25.12,11.44,95.52,68.16,20.9,16.42,8.96,0,1,6.47,0,4.48,5.47,12.94,12.44,7.96,9.45,4.98,20.9,4.98,2.99,1.49,0,2.99,6.47,3.48,2.99,0,1.99,0.5,9.95,1,0,7.46,0,18.91,2.49,1.99,3.98,3.48,1.99,7.46,1.99,0,1.49,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,5.47,1,1,1,2.99,0,6.97,10.95,0,7.46,1.99,1,4.48,1.99,0.5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0.5,0,0,3.98,3.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1a,235,pt,"I was in a situation where I felt like my dorm room wasn't my home and that it was time that I needed to move out. There were constant arguments and the lifestyles of my roommates and I were not the same. I felt like I was always catering to my roommates always having to clean because they were very messy, I could not study in the room because my roommate slept for 12 hours a day and lights were off by 9 pm which was non negotiable to her. I was unable to have friends over because if she had a headache or was tired or if I was just changing for 10 mins they needed to leave.  To let my roommate know I was moving out I texted her and told her ""I just want to let you know that I am moving out across the hall"" my other roommate understood and told me to do what is best for me but this specific roommate was angry.  She asked me why and I said ""I just feel like our lifestyles are different and this is not working out"" she became angry and blocked me on all social media platforms and posted that she was celebrating her roommate that she doesn't like moving out which was childish. I understand that she didn't like the fact that I was moving out and that maybe she was sad and angry but she completely mishandled the situation.  We could have been civil and stayed cordial but she went too far and bashed me to social media.  To make matters worse as I was moving out she made snarky comments about how I need to knock when entering the room even though for 48 hours while I am moving out that is still my room. I chose to not stoop to her level and let her know that it won't happen again because my keys will be turned in the next day and told her good night in which she replied with sarcasm.

1a,274,pt,"I had a conflict with my mother when I was still living with her over my amount of internet consumption. This was an ongoing conflict that we both dreaded occurring. I was (and still do) use the internet as an escape from my life. It led to multiple disagreements, some ending in yelling on my part and retreating into herself on my mothers. Also huge amounts of anxiety for us both, sometimes would both of us ended up crying though I didn't notice her crying unless I looked really closely at her eyes and saw the tears. At the beginning of this conflict, my mom saw my internet consumption as a waste of time and a detriment to my motivation. I could/ can see her point, however, the internet consumption was much more complicated than she realized. It is a habit I learned in middle school as a way to shut out the world, my feelings and my parents fighting. My mother only realized this later. When the conflict first begin, she thought I could easily stop and was just being lazy by choosing to remain on the computer. She only noticed after my dad had left which made me feel that if she hadn't cared much before so why did she care about it now. I definitely had some issues at the time with trusting and sharing my feelings. However, as the years and clashes went on, I became better at articulating my feelings. We had many discussions and she came to realize there was more to my internet use than she thought. Yes it was sometimes detrimental to my sleep and mental health but it was also a product of my mental health- a habit that will probably take years to correct.

Also, the conflicts I have if they happen are relatively small ones that get resolved quickly. My disputes usually revolve around my sister because that is just a normal sibling thing. My sister and I have a super good relationship, but when there are conflicts, they get heated fast but end fast. A common one that most girls sibling can relate to is borrowing each other's stuff without asking. For example, it can be frustrating when you are trying to find an article of clothing, and you find out your sister is wearing it and or it is in her room. We've both been on receiving ends of this conflict and understand how it can make us feel; upset, mad, annoyed, frustrated, etc. Usually, it is my sister who takes my things. We can both agree that it is better to ask before we take, but it is often forgotten and understandable. I know this conflict is minor, but I couldn't think of one off the top of my head.",192,13.51,68.03,84.47,12.09,19.2,18.23,92.71,59.38,21.88,11.98,6.77,2.08,1.56,0.52,1.04,9.9,3.65,10.42,12.5,5.73,8.85,1.04,20.83,5.21,2.08,2.08,1.04,2.6,6.25,2.6,3.65,1.04,2.08,0,12.5,3.12,0,3.12,0,14.06,5.21,2.08,1.04,3.65,0,3.65,0.52,0,0,0.52,1.04,1.04,0,0,0,13.02,5.73,2.6,1.56,3.12,1.04,2.6,18.23,0,13.02,2.6,5.21,6.77,0,0,0.52,0.52,0,0,0.52,0,0,0.52,0,0,14.58,5.21,6.77,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,2.08,0,0

This was not exactly true because I trusted that she had the ability to clean, but the sponge she was using was what I did not trust. I tried to explain to her that I have compulsive problems when it comes to the surfaces I eat off of being clean, but she felt offended that I tried to clean after she already did.

I don't like asking my partner to stop talking to people or become a little distant with someone because I feel like I would be controlling them and I truly believe that people should have their own freedom as individuals. The reason why asked him to do that was because I felt very insecure knowing that they talk a lot since I know how much she means to him, and also, he had previously broke-up with me a couple of months prior to this argument. Once we had fixed our relationship, he confessed to me that he wasn't completely over her. All this, for some reason, made me feel very insecure and during our argument I explained to him my emotions, as well as letting him know that I felt like a second option, or a replacement. He would keep saying that I don't trust him (which I do but not when it comes to her and he knows it) and that I shouldn't ask to stop talking to her because they are just friends.

About a year after we had started the quartet, the sax player wanted to switch instruments from sax to piano. He also wanted to start a new group with him playing piano.

Our little sister wanted to play the game and there was only 2 accounts on the system so I decided that it would be okay if she used his account.

When he confronted her for being a tease, he made her promise not to tell anyone else, so I had to pretend that I didn't know what I knew. Which meant I had to play nice with him, hang out, etc. because ultimately it's her decision even if she's irrationally self-hating. So that's what I did, but I slowly stopped to talking to him over the course of a few months. Now I barely see him but still smile. Still fills me with unexpressed rage.

My best friend, Savvy, and Reagan started fighting our sophomore year over a boy and they fought all junior softball season. Then mine and Savvy's senior year, Reagan was a junior, our coach said that there wouldn't be captains this year when he had always had captains. My best friend and I were overqualified. I started playing softball as a freshman and made it to starting varsity my junior year while being an IB student with above a 4.0 and graduated as Salutatorian while working and volunteering and Savvy had been on varsity since senior year and helped the team a lot over her years. We met with our coach and he said that we couldn't be captains because it would upset other people (he wasn't allowed to say names of any individuals not present) but we knew he was talking with Reagan. She kept making our lives miserable but we convinced our coach that we should be captains and not Reagan and that her opinion/reaction should not dictate what I am deserving of. We had to get parents involved. The entire rest of the season we had to deal with a feud between me and savvy with Reagan and it made the season horrible. She always wanted to be better than us and always wanted the team to see her as superior so she always talked down on us and told everyone on our team to not listen to us or follow us ever. I honestly don't know what was going through her head. I think she was scared that our coach would like us more (he never did) just because he saw him as a father figure because her father wasn't in her life. As well, I think she was scared that the younger/new players would see that Savvy was a better player than her and not go to her for help.

1a,633,pt,"I am in a long distance relationship and have been for nearly 5 years. My partner was visiting his family for a holiday. We typically will call one another to say good night, no matter where we are. Even if it's a short conversation, it is part of our routine and something I can typically rely on occurring. It was 11:45pm and I was waiting for him to text me back letting me know that he could call. He said he would within 10 minutes. I had a meeting the next morning at 8:00, but I hadn't been able to talk to my partner for quite a while and wanted to say good night, which made sense as it would be in under 10 minutes. Half an hour later, I reach out again to check in on him, at which point he calls me. I was a little frustrated because 40 minutes is much different from 10, and I'd have gone to sleep had I known it would take that long. I didn't want him to feel pressured to call me, because his family takes priority. My issue was that he gave me a 10 minute window and didn't stick to it or revoke it. He was frustrated because He felt like he would have lost either way: whether he'd said 10 minutes or not. It was a misunderstanding, because I would have been fine if he had said he wouldn't be around to chat for a while. I'd have gone to sleep. He thought that it was more critical to me that he call at all, and he didn't know it would take so long for him to sort out whatever had been going on.",288,17.32,59.6,33.25,15.92,19.2,12.5,92.01,63.54,22.22,15.28,7.29,1.04,0,6.94,0,6.94,3.82,13.19,15.62,3.12,7.29,2.43,23.61,2.78,2.08,1.74,4.17,2.08,2.78,1.04,1.74,0.35,1.04,0.35,15.28,0.69,0.69,0,6.94,14.58,2.78,1.74,4.17,3.47,0.35,4.17,2.78,0,1.74,0.69,0.69,0.69,0,0,0,6.25,3.47,0.69,0.35,1.74,0,10.76,7.99,0.69,15.28,1.39,8.33,5.9,0.35,1.39,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.85,5.21,3.47,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0

I believe that gay people should have the same rights as everyone and that love is love. The other person believed that because it was not in the bible it should not be considered legal. They also thought that being gay was fine as long as they didn't act upon it. I thought that what they were thinking was ridiculous and not equal at all. Whether something is in the bible or not shouldn't mean anything in politics. We have separated church and state so it shouldn't determine whether something is legal or not.

The very next day she then went and told some of my other friends what I had told her and they came up to me one day and asked if what she told them was true. I wasn't so much mad that the secret was out but more so that she disregarded that I had asked her to not tell anyone and she turns around and tells people. I was upset at first that she had betrayed my trust but then I got really mad at myself and at her. When I confronted her I let anger and rage control what I said, so things went off the rails real quick and it was more about letting her know my rage and not so much about trying to resolve things. Sure, now that I look back I could have handled things better but we were really young at the time and didn't know better and the me now would have definitely done things different.

She would escalate the conflict by giving me the silent treatment, guilt-tripping me, and threaten me. Contrarily, when considering my mother’s side, I can see that she just wanted to have people around so she could feel less lonely. My dad was out of town traveling a lot for work, and mom did not have many friends. While in high school, my mom would put herself into my life by going to concerts, hanging out with my friends, and getting them food, sometimes all without me. In addition, my mom was suffering from mental illnesses, which caused her to act out. This is a physiological and psychological occurrence that affects your whole being. She takes medicine to regulate her thyroid due to it being removed because of cancer. During this time, her medication was wrong, and she was not receiving the correct dosage.

He was telling me that gender is the same thing as sex, male and female, whereas I was telling him that the meaning of gender like many words has changed throughout its usage, especially recently.

He argued that white privilege doesn't exist and that it is wealth that determines privilege, I agreed with him there but pointed out that from the start, white people were set at an advantage. He agreed at the beginning there was an advantage that white people had, but it is now gone because the country has progressed, I didn't and still don't think he is racist or has racist views because of the debate.

He was describing how his team, the packers are the best team because of the quarterback Aaron Rodgers. On the other hand, I was unbiased because my team, the 49ers, didn't't make the playoffs. I said the Kansas city Chiefs will win the superbowl. My facts to this argument was that they made it last year and beat my 49ers in the Super Bowl. There are many NFL announcers saying how much of a better team the Kansas city Cheifs are compared to the Packers. He then compared the wide receivers saying that the packers have pro bowl wide receivers. My counter arguments to that was the Chiefs had a sufficient amount of wide receivers. They also have the best tight end to ever live, Travis Kelce, he broke the record of all tim receiving yards from any tight end ever. I explained this showed how much depth the chiefs have compared to the Packers.

He said that he was ""nervous"" and I told him ""next time to take a better shot or pass the ball."" After I said that he got all defensive.

Unfortunately, the work I was putting in wasn't being reflected in my grade, and there was no way that I was able to get that to change. I talked with her on multiple occasions, made appropriate adjustments, and she still wouldn't budge. Eventually, I was staying in her room through lunch, after school, and putting in time at home, working on projects, still to no avail. Eventually I decided that enough was enough, and I went to another school administrator, asking for an outside opinion and adult help. I realized that this teacher had less interest in my education, and more interest in socialization, something I wasn't completely comfortable with. I became increasingly uncomfortable around her to the point I called my mother in, claiming that I wanted to switch the class. I eventually did, realizing that the teacher was negatively affecting me due to her own personal issues, which she was trying to resolve by essentially forcing me to stay in her room with her.

They did not understand why this school was as important as it was to me. I think they were not thinking about the meaningful aspects, and only thought about what ""made most sense"" to them.

I think that in that situation she felt that I was trying to unreasonably ascribe blame to them, and in a sense ¨taking out my anger on them¨ by repeatedly bringing it up and asking questions about what went on that day. She said some things to me along the lines of ¨I know you´re upset, but it´s not our fault.¨ I felt like she was sort of misrepresenting how I was addressing the situation, trying to characterize my communication with them about why this needed to be addressed as fueled by anger and the need to blame someone. It generally felt like the three of them were all trying to recount the events of that morning in a way that guaranteed that they hadn´t been the one to have left the door unlocked. I wasn´t trying to be aggressive about it but I was frustrated, confused and upset, and the situation felt very unresolved.

He didn't agree with reaching out to the friend to see if they were okay, he thought we should let them be alone. He knew more about the incident and relativeness than I did so he was confident he was being right.

I wonder if even if I saw danger though, if I would have reacted the way she did and I don't think I would have. She was seriously mad, but that goes with her character. In my head it was kinda funny how offended she got, so I made this comment that I wouldn't think she would take very seriously. I said, ""that gave me Karen vibes"". After pausing she told me she didn't like being called or described as ""karen"" and I was honestly scared. I was not ready for her to get upset at me. I responded by making two points: one was that I noted what she said and wouldn't do it again and another was that I clarified that I wasn't calling her ""karen"" I was just saying that what she said gave me karen vibes.

Her reasoning is that she has only been with me while I'm somewhere in the 20s with my partners. While I can understand her concern with not experiencing more in life, it definitely made me feel inadequate and like she was trying to make me a cuck. I'm sure that she didn't feel that way when she brought it up to me, nor do I think that she would have if she had know how it had impacted me tbh. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel, and I think I was able to get it across, but I think she has a difficult time empathizing in a non-selfish manner because she never has had a real relationship before.

1a,1223,pt,"A recent conflict I had was when I told my dad I was quitting baseball. This announcement led to him being extremely angry and disowning me as a son, which felt like an overreaction. To be fair I told him the day before the season was about to start that I didn't want to play anymore, so this element of surprise probably blindsided him a little bit. Since it was so surprising I'm sure he didn't know what to think, which led to a natural response of anger and lashing out. The conflict heightened as he began verbally abusing me and telling me my reasons weren't valid. This led to me arguing back and trying to make him understand that it wasn't something I wanted to do anymore and he had little say in the matter. Unsurprisingly this made the conflict turn physical as he tried to push me and physically threaten me. While I understand where his anger came from, as baseball is an important part of his identity and his connection to me, the physical and verbal assaults weren't justified. In hindsight, I could've told him how I felt months ago and made the conversation much more gradual instead of just dumping it on him.

1a,1308,pt,"One conflict I have has has been between my boyfriend and I. I am undoubtably a night owl who stays up late and does homework until late at night, leaving not much time to talk to anyone until well past 12:30 am. My boyfriend on the other hand, has been going to bed early, around 10 or 10:30pm and is always annoyed by my sleep schedule. Granted, we do not live together so it is more about our schedules not lining up in other aspects of our lives and me being tired most days than one of us keeping the other awake. His reasoning is that sleep is extremely important (he's not wrong) and necessary for his functioning and difficult workouts the next day. He would rather sacrifice social time than miss sleep, and he feels I should live my life the same way. I however, prioritize work and social time over sleep, and often actually find enjoyment when I am staying up late with friends or on a late night adventure. I also know I will not sleep restfully unless I have gotten done all I have wanted to in the day and find I am almost most productive in the early hours of the morning. Where we find conflict is neither of us conform to the others' expectations and then occasionally get upset with one another when plans cannot happen, or things get missed because of it. I won't go to bed once my boyfriend and I stop hanging out at 9:30pm on the weekends and often go to see other friends afterwards, and it bugs him. He isn't willing to break his sleep schedule for nearly anything, which sometimes bugs me if there is something I still wanted to do or if I want to talk to him later at night. This is a trivial conflict, and exists due to stubbornness rather than lack of communication, but it is not unresolvable.

She lives in our dorm hall and is the roommate of one of our friends. We had tried to talk to her and explain our concerns and our fears because we felt that she was being irresponsible and putting our health at risk. She continuously denied being unsafe and thought that we were overreacting, when in reality she was hanging around unsafe individuals who had actually contracted COVID-19. She felt like we were just upset that she was hanging out with new friends and attacked our character rather than addressing the actual situation at hand. We felt kind of betrayed by our friend because we felt like she did not care about our feelings or concerns which was very frustrating to deal with. We got our RA involved and tried to have conversations with her because our friend's roommate (my friend) was very uncomfortable living in the same room with her if she was going to be attending parties.

In my defense I couldn't do anything about him liking me and not her but I should have prioritized my best friend over him.

But obviously I was not just going to stop being friends with my guy friends so whenever I hung out with them it had to be a secret otherwise Kelli would freak out and that sucked that I had to keep my friendship with my guy friends a secret. Then one night Kelli was talking crap about Chance and his girlfriend so I texted Nick asking him what I should do because Kelli was saying messed up stuff. She found out that I texted Nick about it and she blew up at me saying I was a horrible friend and that I always choose the guys over my girl friends and it was ridiculous and like I guess I can understand why she would be mad but at the same time I feel like she was just saying all of this because she got caught for talking trash and was finally called out on it.

Someone might take this change as a new way to rig the election in favor of someone's political party, which is unacceptable, and a possible risk/danger to the US. They think this because the constant ""fake news"" leaves every citizen to interpret our political climate in their way, usually leading to one person, party, or organization being portrayed as some secret villain. In this view, anything out of the ordinary (real or not) is immediately weaponized to destroy someone's reputation. Take the outrageous idea that Obama faked his citizenship as an example of something random becoming an unreasonable doubt spread to ruin his campaign.

In high school, I was on my school's softball team and I had a conflict with one of my teammates. It was really a conflict between one half of the team and the other but it felt like me and one other girl were at the forefront. She and some other teammates had suggested we wear white softball pants for some of our games. This seems fine but in reality, I didn't think it was very logical. White didn't go with our jersey, we had already paid for a grey and a black pair of pants that actually matched our uniform, and nearly half the team did not own white pants. Still, she kept bringing it up and eventually went around us to the coach who said we would be wearing white at the next game. She was the best pitcher in the league and I felt like she thought that it meant that she could get whatever she wanted. I felt like she didn't care at all about what me and half the team were trying to tell her. I think she felt frustrated that we were denying her wants but I also feel like she wasn't even listening to what we were saying. Again, I try to avoid conflict but I did imply that she was being pretty ridiculous considering what a hassle and cost it would be for so many of us just so she could wear white pants for like three games. Looking back, I think this girl and I just weren't on the same page about a lot of things and our personalities did not mesh well together.

1a,784,asother,The problem with Hailey is that she is not being considerate of the household we live in and the other people that could be affected by her decisions. By seeing other people outside of this household even with a face mask she would affect the people she cares about like her father who has a very serious health issue that COVID could produce worse symptoms for. Especially since we are leaving for a plane in less than two weeks she should be careful and not see anyone to lower her chances of being affected by COVID. This distance between her friends will only be a couple more months and she has lasted this long without seeing them she can go for a couple more weeks. We have been making sacrifices for our family for 6 years now and especially in this isolated time she should be careful not to worsen this sacrifices we make that could cause serious harm to her loved ones. We were initially going to have this trip planned and Hailey knew that she had to be very careful and especially since many of her friends are in college the exposure statistic is even higher. In California the cases are extremely high and we could possibly go into lockdown so there should be no desire to see them so desperately. Soon she will be reunited with her entire family and have the ability to spend Christmas together while some families can't have that privilege. Even though it may be a while before she sees her friends it will be worth it for their health because when you choose not to see them you lower your chances at putting them more at risk. It is also unfair to the house we live in when we are guests and if we gave them COVID because of a mistake we would feel terrible and feel like we are taking them for granted.,322,29.72,95.01,1.44,2.04,32.2,16.15,94.41,63.35,18.63,12.42,0,3.73,0.93,5.59,2.17,6.21,4.66,14.29,13.35,6.21,6.52,2.17,20.81,4.97,3.73,0.93,0.62,2.8,5.9,1.55,4.35,0.62,0,0.93,17.39,1.24,1.24,5.59,0.31,14.91,1.55,3.42,4.04,1.55,1.55,3.42,2.48,1.86,0,0.62,2.17,0.31,1.55,0,0,11.18,6.52,0.62,1.55,0.62,1.86,2.48,12.73,1.86,12.42,1.86,5.28,5.28,0.62,0.93,1.86,0.62,0.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.42,3.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.31,0,0

They were hugging, so I thought that was weird, considering he was dating a girl that was not on the band retreat.

Once I got back from the retreat, I made my friend aware of what he had been doing, that he was hugging another girl, and she was extremely upset.

This was challenging for me because we had only had slight banter about politics and never had gotten heated so hearing people close to them getting so upset made me worry that I had hurt them. After messaging them to apologize and ask if my comment had really gone to far, they brushed it off and said that no their brother and friend were overreacting. I didn't understand this because they were in the same room as both their brother and friend and yet didn't care to explain to them that it was just a comment and not a attack on their political stanse or them as a person despite us being friends for over 16 years.

She claimed that if those people are happy with their lifestyle yet don't force others to join them, she was perfectly fine with gays having their rights. She thought that a relationship is based on love and that love is a very personal thing. She respected people no matter what they fell in love with. I argued back by asking her if she was okay with the idea of someone wanting to have a relationship with a cat or an orange. She responded yes because it is that person's choice and has nothing to do with her.

Subject number two ignores subject number one when he sends her a text or call. This makes it hard for him to know what's going on or where his kids are at. It also stresses him out to the point where he becomes lethargic from sadness. The lack of motivation due to sadness makes pursuing the goal to graduate a bit more difficult.

1a,244,as3party,"Kevin was student at the University of Oregon looking to switch his major. He completed the information needed to formally switch his major with the registrar over a month prior before registration for the next term but it was never switched in time. When he needed to register for a class required and only allowed to be taken by people in his new major, Duckweb would not allow him because no one at the registrar's office ever switched his major. When Kevin sat down with the someone in the registrar's office to figure out the problem the person helped little. James, the person Kevin met with in the office, first started by providing Kevin the wrong information. He told Kevin the school his major was in would just override the rule and let him register for the class. When Kevin left the meeting and went to his respective school, he was informed that that has never been allowed someone at the registrar's office just needed to fix it for him. When Kevin went back and met with James for a second time, James showed very little remorse. He said that at this point Kevin would just have to wait until someone else in the office got around to switching it for him. Kevin then proceeded to ask James if he had the ability to change it right now, and if it would take very long, to which James said he could but he had to much other stuff to do. Kevin was upset because it was his day to sign up for classes and all he needed was James to fix it for him very quickly, and it still didn't happen even after a over a month of waiting for this process to be complete. James was probably really irritated because it is stressful working for the registrar's office during registration week and they have hundreds of student's majors to switch.

She disagreed because she said she had been cleaning the house a lot lately and had been doing the dishes frequently. Alex said that he does just as much to help out around the house as she does. Ally commented back that he did not do this because he was at work a lot. Alex refuted this claim by saying that is why she should do the dishes because he is working right now and she is not. Ally claimed that that had nothing to do with household responsibilities. Alex was clearly annoyed because he has a busier schedule than Ally and felt like she had more time to help out. Ally was irritated because even though she did not work she was busy with online school so she too was busy. I could see where they both were coming from and I think there should should possibly be a schedule for chores so this argument is avoided in the future and their schedules can be taken into account.,200,8.75,87.49,1.59,1.65,20,13.5,95,66,17,12,2,0,0,8.5,1.5,5,5,10,19.5,8,8,2,24.5,3.5,3,1.5,0,2.5,3,0,3,1,1.5,0,18,1,2,5.5,4,11.5,1,3,2.5,1.5,1,2.5,2.5,0.5,1.5,0.5,1.5,0,0,0,1.5,6.5,3.5,1.5,1.5,0.5,0.5,11,11,1.5,13.5,1,5.5,7.5,6,0,2,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0

Friend one is being unreasonable with asking last minute and expecting that an hour and a half is close to where friend two needed to be. This puts a lot of stress on friend two because they want to help friend one but does not want to miss their family plans that they promised to be at. Friend one does not understand this and is very upset and irritated and even won't talk with friend two anymore. Friend one is mostly thinking of themselves and friend two is caught between thinking about everyone. Friend one puts friend two in a very difficult situation and friend two should not cave to help friend one when they have family plans.,217,49.32,92.33,7.7,3.61,24.11,9.68,95.39,53.46,9.68,5.53,0,0,0,1.84,3.69,3.69,4.61,13.36,11.98,5.99,8.76,2.3,19.82,1.38,0.46,2.3,10.14,0.46,3.23,0.46,2.76,1.38,0.46,0.46,19.82,1.38,8.76,1.84,0,11.06,1.38,0.92,3.69,1.84,0.92,3.23,0.46,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.82,11.52,0.92,0.92,0.92,0.46,1.84,15.21,3.69,13.36,3.23,7.37,2.76,0.92,1.38,1.84,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.53,4.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.38,0,0
1a,408,as3party,"There were two students arguing about their friendship in High School. One of the guys was really in love with this girl since kindergarten, but when he told his friend that he really liked her, the friend started flirting with her the next day. After the girl fell in love with the friend, the guy who truly liked her decided to try to move on. Deep down he liked the other girl still but he started to like a different girl. When his friend found out about the new girl, the friend decided that it was not okay that he should be happy, so he started dating her the next day. The friend kept on doing this to the man, that made the first guy start to question their friendship. The first guy would always get picked on because he was never going to be in a relationship, so he must be weird, but anytime a chance was given, the friend would get in the way. This was a bad friend, but the first guy was too nice that he would forgive the friend, because life is too short to be mad at someone for something they did. Throughout his entire time in school he never had a relationship which was sad because he is a great guy. Everyone deserves a friend like this, but his friend is toxic. This conflict was never resolved, but the first guy will never forget the upsetting time he had to go through. He still likes the girl from kindergarten, but believes he will never get the chance to be with her because of his friend.

1a,492,as3party,I was in a group chat with two of my friends and one was trying to spread awareness on issues about our country. On one side my friend trying to get her point across did seem like she was bashing the guy but he was not complying. He was only seeing the views from his side and continues to believe that way. She was simply trying to say how he uses his white privilege to vote third party when there are peoples' lives are in danger. He was countering the argument with the same points that didn't quite make sense. He said he will be voting third party because he wants to contribute to the success of the third party for basic human rights. As she also points out if he was mindful about human rights and that votes go to the incumbent in office it would lead the to having another 4 years of trump which would not help any of us.

He was adamant that she should take a break, rather than quit outright. Both were calm, but it was easy to see that he was internally freaking out. She explained that her classes this term were far more work than the previous term, a full 16 credits rather than about 13. These were classes with lots of reading, too, and she was sacrificing both sleep and her academics for little reward. She was careful to tell him that she loved the team and was sad that she couldn't balance, but her academics needed to come first. As she walked away, having agreed that she'd take a break and let him know how she was feeling by the end of the week, he sat on the bench with an almost heartbroken look. The next day, she talked to a fellow teammate and realized she had to tell him that she had made up her mind. She sent him a text, saying a summarized version of her side of the conversation the other day, explaining that no, really, she needed to focus on school. In response, he asked ""Is there anything I can say or do to make you stay?"" She was frustrated by the fact that he still hadn't gotten the message, but responded politely and in a way that thankfully got no response.

1a,566,as3party,"I will be using B to describe the person I have had the conflict with and R as to describe myself.

B and R are roommates and best friends, they get along so well because they are so similar. They are both so sweet and genuine, they both love to travel and are both introverts. They are so close that they even share a bed, but with sharing a room there is limited alone time, something they both need as introverts. They tend to live in this cycle of having a really good and fun friendship to hardly talking and giving one another attitude. They are both so selfless that they never want to explain how they are personally feeling, thus the cycle continues. 

From the outside, the relationship can seem toxic for B and R. However, they are each other's person, the one who understands everything and affirms their feelings. I think they both need to learn to be more selfish in a way though. Watching them go through the cycle of having a good and bad friendship is confusing and makes me sad to see.

The man has been quiet for a while when she was cooking for him, the reason is not clear, and it seems the reason may also not be quite clear to him.  She is upset at him; she gets uncomfortable when it's quiet, she has a hard time introspecting or being alone with her thoughts, unlike the man.  They are in her room now, sitting on the bed, unsure of what to talk about.  The man looks sullen, the woman looks irritated, but also sad.  They sit like this for a while, silent, but both lost in thought.  The woman inquires into the man's status but he is steadfast, muttering an ""I don't know"" or an ""I'm fine"".  The woman prompts drug use, but the man requests she hang back for a second, intent on telling her something.  It takes him many minutes to muster his courage to tell her what is on his mind, but when he finally does it feels great.  This confession leads to a flurry of other confessions, things he has not told many people if any at all.  He sits on the bed crying mostly silent tears, staring off into the distance while the woman tries to comfort him.  He begins asking the woman to ask him anything she wants to know, about past interactions they have had with others, or just about events the woman was unsure about in the past.  This prompts more tears, this time on both ends, and more discussion.  Eventually, they tire, with their minds fried and their bodies exhausted.  One last confession, the woman tells the man she is bisexual.  The man takes a second, then embraces her, making it seem like he did not know this prior.  He inquires into her hesitancy to tell him, and she confesses she just needed time, needed practice telling other people before she could tell him.

1a,1114,as3party,"I began middle school from a distance, separated from my close friends. Starting fresh was inevitable. I thought I would make friends as easily as I did before. However, this did not really work as planned. The second week of school came and by this tIme, I was fed up with being alone at recess. I decided to introduce myself to the other black kids on my school’s basketball team at lunch. I noticed they all seemed close and seeing how we all had something in common, I thought I would immediately be accepted. Sadly, my optimism was in for a rude awakening. Hanging out with this crowd gave me a false sense of comfort, while hiding the new wounds of insecurities that would come down the road. Each day did not come with laughter but with venomous ridicules about my ethnicity. Skin color at this point did not matter. I was “African” and “American”, but I was not raised in African-American culture. Because of this, I was deemed an outcast of this group whether black or not. I knew deep down this was not right, but my childish perspective was only fixated on fitting in with the social norm. Nevertheless, I continued to endure this, despite what I felt on the inside.



Enduring all this negativity could only go so far. One day I hit my limit when my peers thought a harmless prank would go well. They dumped chocolate milk on my newly bought white shoes. I was annoyed, infuriated, and depressed; however, defeat was not in this mix. Instead of running away, I faced this situation head-on. Instead of obnoxious yelling, my tone was calm and sharp. I went to them and asked a simple question... “why?” Why did they need to act like we were different as if we were not all human beings at the end of the day? From their facial expressions, I can see they were perplexed by this question. Honestly, I was too.

Watching two people begin to get closer, with emotions tensing up leads to a third-party observer waiting for a moment to possibly intervene.

I think that as soon as there are real punches or attacks tat begin, someone should intervene before a major disaster occurs. Often, there is that bystander shock if a fight goes down and that can be a barrier to helping, but a situation that has the potential to escalate very quickly is something that should be at least loosely monitored.

They are met with physicality and a barrage of words back. After multiple unprompted attacks, the subject finally retaliated with his own words and that led to a physical altercation.

1a,1257,as3party,"Recently, a mother had a disagreement with her eldest daughter about how to handle the mental health of the youngest daughter. The eldest daughter currently lives in Oregon and is a full-time student, while the mother lives back home in Maryland with the youngest daughter, who is a junior in high school. The mother decided that the behavior the youngest daughter was exhibiting was attention-seeking, but the eldest knew that it was the behavior of a very depressed person pleading for help. The youngest daughter regularly seeks advice from her older sister, texting back and forth and calling to chat every day. The mother does not pay attention to the issues brought up by the younger daughter, so the eldest daughter usually has to pay their mother a call to try her hand at resolving the issue. The eldest daughter has chipped away at the iron will of her mother over time and spends the calls trying to deescalate any tension, sometimes even acting as an emotional punching bag. However, the recent accusation of the youngest daughter being attention seeking when the eldest daughter knows that in actuality, it's a cry for help, has caused a drought in communication. The most recent phone call devolved into shouting, and after the call ended, tears.

One party states that getting a vaccine is a personal choice, even if someone has no health complications that would inhibit them from getting a vaccine.

The first party says that because of their mistrust in the validity of the vaccine, they can understand why some people wouldn't want to have it in their body. The other party says that because the vaccine was approved for emergency use by the FDA, it is safe to take. The conflict is that the first party believes that there is no moral obligation for anyone to take a vaccine while the second party believes that there is. The second party states that negligence to create the safest possible environment for people at risk would implicate that person if someone were to be hurt as a consequence of their choice to not get the vaccine. The first party argues that if someone is at risk, it would be only their fault if they got sick.

Along the way, two of my friends found a shopping cart that was a bit off of the store property and wanted to bring it with us. Not only did this feel like stealing to me and our one other friend, but it was getting late, this was in an area that we had never been to before, the cart caused a ruckus, and it slowed us down considerably. They, however, just wanted to have fun and we had all had a very long and difficult day with several travel issues along the way. They told us that they would not steal it, they would bring it back on the way to the bus stop the next day (which the eventually did do). I understand their frustration and their desire for distraction and doing something fun. While their actions were somewhat questionable, they were not actually hurting anyone, we did get there safely, if a bit nervous, and they did return the cart. It also, however, add to our other friend's stress levels which were already quite high. To combat this, the other friend and I walked separatly from them, but near enough to keep an eye on the other two, to ensure all of our safety and so I could help calm down the other friend. While not detrimental as it could have been in the end, it was not an ideal situation.",272,44.54,69.67,59.39,20.23,24.73,12.5,93.01,65.07,18.38,9.93,1.84,4.41,0,0,3.68,8.46,9.56,13.24,9.93,6.62,8.09,2.21,17.28,3.68,1.1,1.84,1.47,2.94,5.88,2.57,2.94,0.74,0.74,0.37,11.03,0,1.84,0,0,13.97,1.47,0.37,3.68,1.84,1.1,6.25,1.1,0.37,0,0.74,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,12.5,6.62,0.74,1.47,2.57,1.47,9.19,4.78,0.74,16.54,3.31,7.72,6.62,0,1.84,0.37,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.76,4.04,6.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.37,0.74,0

My ex and I did not end up on great terms, so I'm sure he was mad. They apparently had become friends over their negative feelings towards me.

We would text and call each other constantly and help each other with problems and such. I started to like him, but when he found out, he dropped the friendship and stopped talking to me. Fast forward four years to my freshman year in college when he randomly added me on Snapchat and proceeded to tell me that he was very sorry for how he had treated me and that he had changed and wanted to try to become friends again. My feelings came back once we started talking again, and this time around it seemed like he was open to potentially starting a relationship. He was in the marines, and came home to visit his family for Christmas and we got to hang out for a little while and talk in person about life. He then had to return, so we continued talking about things we could do once he was back and we could hang out again. While I was at work, a coworker overheard me talking about this person, and the coworker said """"hey, he's been talking to other people and his brother says he has a girlfriend"""". I then proceeded to text the person and his younger brother to clarify if this was true. Indeed it was, and the person blocked me.

The main source of the conflict was him purposefully sabotaging the game by playing small words in places that kept the game from expanding across the board.

I do think it's a very annoying thing to do regardless though. I think he has mostly forgotten about it, but my mother and I still remember it. I guess he probably felt a little shocked by how upset I became because in his mind he did nothing wrong and was just having fun.

She really wants to keep a relationship with him because she hasn't had a successful relationship in a while, despite not really enjoying it. I think she knows she doesn't actually want to be with him but just wants a relationship. After they were intimate for the first time she told me about some things he did that made her uncomfortable. I told her that she should tell him she doesn't want to see him anymore because even if he didn't intend to make her uncomfortable, he should have known better and not have asked her to do the things he did. I think she's feeling a lot of anxiety about what to do next because she wants to continue the idealized relationship she thought this would be like in the beginning. I also know that she's very empathetic and doesn't want to hurt him because she knows he really likes her. However, I don't think that you should stay with someone because you could hurt their feelings, or bet on it getting better. I've told her that she should break it off before things get serious and if he even made her a little uncomfortable, she should look for someone who's more respectful. She agrees that this isn't a relationship she wants and all of her other friends agree she should tell him she no longer wants to see him.

It was growing much more difficult to find time to spend with him once summer came around due to his work schedule and the fact that my mother hardly let me see him. She liked him well enough, but yet she hated me going out and was very strict about always knowing where I was at any given moment. This resulted in me having a phone tracker. This situation really frustrated me, but both of my parents worked every week day, so without saying anything I had my boyfriend come over when they were gone. My mom would let me go over to his house alone for days time on occasions, so I felt it was basically the same principle. However, I knew that she wouldn't like how I didn't ask permission for him to come over. She wound up coming home early for a small break, and found us watching a movie in my bed. We were both fully clothed. She screamed at him to get out, all he had to put on to leave was his shoes. Once he left she took my phone so that I couldn't speak to him. She told me if he came back to the property that she would call the cops and file a restraining order on him. Luckily I was able to text him over my laptop to not come back, otherwise I know he would have tried to come back and talk about it with her. She took my phone for 4 days and after that I was only allowed to use it when she watched. She then grounded me for an entire month, refusing me to see any of my friends or my boyfriend, and I had to cancel plans she had already agreed too letting me do.

After we both left our hometown to go to our individual colleges, my boyfriend was having a difficult time with the transition.

As I entered the living room, my new pup looked like she was feeling sick (lethargic, woozy, dizzy, confused, shaking, trembling, sleepy). My father was keeping her company on the couch and cuddling her and making sure she was okay. I did some examination to see if what she was experiencing may have been from eating something, like maybe a pill on the floor. I felt examined her: paws, her stomach, nose, observed her eyes, and searched the house for any pill bottles that may have fallen. I was extra worried that she may have eaten a pill of some sort, because my parents are so so decent dog owners, but they're also not the most aware people in the world with how disorganized their house is. Additionally, our older dog Sophie also had this experience several years ago, and almost died from liver/kidney failure because of the same exact situation. For our older dog (Sophie), my parents almost didn't go to the vet because they thought that Sophie could've handled it. I pushed my parents to take Sophie to the vet, and the vet told me I basically saved my dogs life. Anyway, I didn't want to take any chances with our younger pup who was also going through a similar experience. Since we cannot identify the substance causing her to feel this way, I said to my parents that we should just take her straight to the vet. To simplify, it was late at night, they were very tired, and the vet is expensive. They were both hesitant to take her to the vet, and I was stressing hard. My parents ended up observing her most of the night and did not take her to the vet; so it was very hard for me to see them make that decision because of the unpredictability.

Unfortunately, none of us had any means of transportation beyond the PeaceHealth bike system, and that would have been far too long of a bike ride for any sane people to attempt. This led us to Uber out there, but much to our dismay, upon arrival, we found that our phones had zero service, and we had zero means of getting back to campus. We then agreed to cross that bridge when we got to it, and we had a wonderful time hiking.

I knew that no Uber driver would either A: be willing to drive all the way out to Fall Creek or B: be in the area and be willing to drive all the way back to Eugene. I pointed this out, but Jeff would not give in. He attempted to hail an Uber around seven times, with zero drivers returning his call. I understand that he thought that the Uber would be cheaper, but even so, a cheaper mode of transportation does not help when it is not offered.

1b,136,pt,"Last year we had one full week of having so much snow that schools were canceled and some people couldn't even make it to work. The driving conditions were quite scary. My mom was working nightshifts and my dad was still having tiring days at work in this weather. Roughly at 10 pm one night during this week, my dad was sleeping. I heard our home phone ring and then his phone, and then my phone went off. It was my grandpa calling. He said that my grandma had lost her memory of most of the events pertaining to that entire month. I was on speaker with the two of them and she couldn't remember our family friend passing away in the 3 weeks prior or remember her tooth surgery she had a month ago. She couldn't even remember that it was snowing terribly. This was very scary because my grandmother had never had issues like this before, and was normally sharp as can be. She proceeded to forget in a matter of seconds anything new we told her either, every time she learned of our friend's passing she would begin crying again and again. My grandpa didn't know what to do so I know we had to get over to their house as soon as possible. I woke up my dad to tell him, but I'm pretty sure he just assumed I was over reacting. I told him it was urgent and from having such an exhausting week at work I think he lastly wanted to head over there when it was getting so late. He then called my grandpa to see for himself, having to have the same conversation with he two of them that I just had on the phone. I told him that my grandpa needed to call the ambulance, but him being tired and probably still thinking I was an over reacting kid who didn't know much, said that it should be fine if we went over there, then we could take her to the hospital ourselves if we thought we needed too. He got off the phone with my grandpa and wound up calling another friend of his for advice, taking another 15+ minutes to be on the phone and get dressed again. In this time I was able to convince my grandpa to call an ambulance, which turns out what would have been what saved her had she had a stroke, and initially that is what the first-responders thought had happened. I wound up staying at the hospital by my grandma's side as she went through different scans, being the one to calm her down. I told both my grandpa and dad to not bring up our friend's passing away either while she couldn't remember. Her memory came back within maybe 5 hours of her being at the hospital, the loss being due to something called transient global amnesia. I know my father was grateful for me afterwards, he told me he was impressed with how I handled everything. I think he was scared about how life would change so much had she actually suffered memory loss or a stroke. I think him being in denial was his way of helping him assume that I was over reacting.",546,28.65,84.32,41.95,15.47,22.75,15.75,95.24,60.62,21.98,16.3,6.78,2.2,0,6.78,0.55,5.68,4.03,13.92,11.17,5.13,6.59,1.47,21.25,3.85,2.01,1.65,1.83,2.2,3.3,1.28,2.01,0.55,0,0.92,18.5,3.11,0.37,4.03,5.68,12.64,3.85,1.47,2.75,2.75,0.92,2.38,2.93,0.37,2.01,0.55,2.75,0.55,2.2,0,0,7.88,2.93,1.65,2.2,1.1,0.37,11.54,5.31,0.92,16.3,2.2,6.78,7.69,1.1,0.18,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.34,4.4,2.75,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,1.83,0,0.18

This person also said â€œI fucking hate cis peopleâ€?. This person was the person I disagree the most with how they handled the situation for simplicity's sake i'll call them A. the person I sided more with will be called B. so B was offended by this because theyâ€™re cisgender. And it escalated from there. A said they didnt care and that when Bâ€™s kind (cis people) stop murdering, deadnaming and misgendering trans people then theyll talk. As someone who is also trans I understand some of Aâ€™s feelings. I have had a lot of bad experiences with cis people and in the context of opression its totally valid to say that you hate cis people, because hate crimes against trans people do exist and trans people die because of it. I also know why Aâ€™ was weary about B saying that they make an effort to not deadname, misgender or murder anyone. Performative allyship is a thing. A lot of time people say there an ally but never do anything to stand up for trans people and continue to deadname and misgender them without even trying to make an effort to not do that. My parents were like that too and told me to not correct them when they get my pronouns wrong because it sounded rude to them (even though I was trying to ask as politely as I could) and that if I did that they would be less willing to be an ally. A started getting personal and directly insulting B though which I can't agree with because B genuinely did seem like they were actually making an effort to learn and weren't just being a fake ally like my parents were. But just because they make an effort doesnt mean theres still more to learn about being an ally.

Around the same time, a lot of our friends had also moved in together and their new house was only a few minutes away from ours. One of my roommates in particular, Bri, was spending a lot of time there - almost more time than she was spending at our own house. Then, when the wildfires in Oregon started to get worse, Lane County started sending out evacuation warnings to people living in the effected areas. When Lane County sent out a Level 3 evacuation notice, Bri and the rest of my roommates were at our friends' house, while I was home alone frantically packing an overnight bag. Bri and our friends tried to work out a game plan in case we had to evacuate, but since all of this planning was done in person, I was not informed of what we were going to do. Bri had been trying to text me while everyone was talking but was only able to send a few messages. Then, when I called her in a panic, she tried to calm me down and say everything was fine. I did not respond well to this kind of nurturing and instead asked for her and my roommates to come home to pack their own bags and help me prepare our house in case we had to leave.

I voted no because I don't believe that they should be kept in jail longer. If they were kept in jail longer then that means more taxes for everyone else. I also think that having more time in jail means that it will be harder to rehabilitate them. Voting yes means a lot of money in taxes and less money for important things like mental health. My father was so adamant about me voting no on all the other props that would increase taxes but decides to vote yes on this prison bill. He continued to hassle me about the issue and I continued to state my mind and had voted no. My entire family had also voted in the same way I had.

I asserted that it's fair to be frustrated, but that frustrations should be brought up before the breaking point, because it isn't fair to expect me to stay level-headed and rational while I'm being harshly scolded.

For example they believed that putting the """"I"""" in front was reserved for significant others and family members, so people that were very meaningful to them. On the other side of the argument the person believed that putting the """"I"""" in front was meaningless and meant the same thing either, it was just easier to shorten the phrase.

1b,143,asother,Me and a group of friends were working on a project in high school to redesign the daily schedule. My friend thought it was best to start at the same time arguing that it was most important to push every after school activity and homework time back so students didn't go to bed later. I argued that classes needed to start later because it was most important that students be awake and alert in their classes so they learn. We start having a calm debate about what would be the best way to redesign the schedule. As we continue in our debate we begin to get slightly heated less so over the topic of the debate and more in frustration that we weren't listening to what the other person thought. Because the debate was getting heated and my friend didn't want to fight she said that ultimately it was a school project and this detail didn't matter in the greater scheme of things.

1b,148,asother,"Growing up, I have always been a relatively shy person. However, a few ways I deal with my shyness and social anxiety is through music (I play the piano) and theater, although for the majority of high school, my experience with theater was mostly on the script-writing, directing, and lighting side of things. In my senior year however, I decided to audition for the fall play and it was a major success in the community, attracting capacity crowds of 600 over a span of 3 nights. From hereon, my confidence grew exponentially, as I was getting congratulated by people I didn't even know, over the next few months, this confidence snowballed into other aspects of my life. Most of my friends noticed these changes, particularly my decreased social anxiety, however- one of my closest friends who I've known for almost 10 years told me his opinion on this: He thought that it was a toxic and unhealthy mindset to, according to him, 'feel good from other people's validation' and told me that if I were to raise my confidence, it should be intrinsic, and not dependent of other people's opinions of me.

The drive from LA to Eugene is about 14 hours long, so it is a pretty hefty amount of time to drive straight for a normal person. My dad, however, is quite stubborn and he insists on doing everything in one go, especially road trips. He decided to get a decent amount of sleep, drink a couple Monster energy drinks on the drive, and try to gun it in one go. However, my stepmom and I asked him to take a break about halfway through and get some sleep, or let her drive once the sun started to come up (she is afraid to drive in pitch black conditions). At first, he thought that our input was not relevant, and said that he could get through the drive in one go if he just had something to distract him and keep him awake. Once we started the drive, however, he held up until we got to around Central/Northern California, where he started to get very sleepy and did not want to keep on driving. Once again, we told him to stop somewhere to nap for a few hours and then continue on when he was rested a bit. Eventually, he gave in and ended up napping for about 4 hours, to which he continued until it was about 8am and the sun was out, and my stepmom took control and let my dad sleep longer until we arrived at our hotel.",280,67.14,76.25,83.26,31.88,31.11,12.86,91.43,56.43,15,11.43,3.57,2.14,0,5.71,0,3.21,5.36,18.57,6.07,7.14,9.29,0.71,17.5,2.86,0.71,1.43,3.57,2.14,2.14,1.07,0.71,0.36,0.36,0,11.79,1.43,0,0.71,6.07,7.86,1.07,0.36,1.43,2.86,0.71,2.5,0.71,0.36,0.36,0,2.14,1.43,0,0,0.71,8.57,2.5,1.07,2.14,2.5,0.36,7.86,6.79,1.07,26.79,5.71,9.64,11.07,0,1.79,0.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.79,3.21,7.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,0.36

My friend disagreed entirely bringing up points of gender dysphoria and how it is a mental condition and that if the army was strict on other conditions then that they should be strict on that one as well. I couldn't bring myself to agree with him as studies found a very minimal percent of transgenders even had gender dysphoria, they were just choosing what made them happier.

1b,374,as3party,There was a party to attend over this weekend. But the rules were Johnny had to finish both chores and homework before going which seem valid. I think Johnny not doing the homework when is was assigned was a poor choice and caused him problems later. Even though he was able to finish half the load and maybe tried to get to go with half of it not done using his reason was just a hope. I can understand where the mother was coming from because I feel like any parent would usually have that in mind finish your responsibilities first. On the other hand though I can see how Johnny did have a point with him having more time to do the homework since he had a later due date. In all I think the mother was just keeping her word so that he knows he can be pulling this stuff constantly. In regards of the scenario though I think Johnny should have just done his homework in a more effective manner which could have lead to a different outcome. As for the mother I think she did the right thing and overall it would be a learning lesson for Johnny on time management and procrastination.,207,42.38,51.93,58.07,25.77,23,11.11,93.72,61.35,14.01,8.7,3.38,0,0.48,4.83,0,5.31,8.7,12.08,14.98,7.25,6.76,0.97,23.67,3.86,3.86,2.42,1.45,2.42,1.93,0.97,0.97,0,0,0,8.21,1.93,0.48,2.42,3.86,18.84,6.28,4.35,2.9,2.9,0.48,3.86,1.45,0.48,0,0.97,0.48,0.48,0,0,0,5.8,0.97,1.93,2.42,0.48,0.48,7.25,11.59,1.45,16.43,2.9,5.31,8.21,5.8,0.97,2.42,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.35,4.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the uncle had responded that he had to be like that because that was the only way how people were going to listen to his ideas. That kept going on back and forth for a little bit after.

She's staunchly pro-life and very adamant that all abortions for any reason are deeply morally wrong and no one should get one ever. She believes it should be completely illegal. I on the other hand am very pro-choice, people should be able to determine on their own what is right for them if they find themselves pregnant. I also believe that life is more in lines with the scientific definition of life at the brain-level rather than a heartbeat that she defines as life. We argue about this a lot and neither of us come out feeling better. We just kind of debated each other, I thought she was too cruel and she probably thought the same of me. The thing we were fighting about specifically is the new at the time abortion laws in New York allowing termination of pregnancy up beyond 20 weeks for non-vaible fetuses.

At that point, I started getting a little bit more agitated, though I don't think that I was being rude. I told her that those ideas are half baked, if they're baked at all, and that she should do some research somewhere reputable. I suggested that she look at the Johns Hopkins covid dashboard, about the covid vaccines, and to look at their website for information regarding other vaccines, as well.

At the end we stayed friends, but it is not the same  like before because the trust is not there. This illustrates how easily a simple misunderstanding can escalate into a conflict between friends. Good friends are expected to be reliable, willing to listen, caring and supportive. Friends should be able to work through what ever problems no matter what. Two parts to effective communication involves: presenting information and active listening. Without both, resolving conflict is impossible, as is maintaining your friendships. Practice these skills: Think before speaking. Know exactly what message you want to convey. Make sure your friend has your full attention and understands your meaning. Stay focused on the matter at hand, be clear and precise. Listen to yourself speak. This is just to show that Maria and Rosa had poor listening skills.",325,51.43,67.77,53.59,71.93,17.11,18.46,86.77,53.54,17.23,11.38,6.46,0.62,1.85,0,2.46,5.85,4.31,13.85,8,3.69,7.38,1.85,19.38,5.23,2.77,2.15,0.62,1.23,5.23,3.69,1.23,0,0,0,13.54,0,1.85,0,0,15.08,4.62,1.85,3.69,2.15,1.54,3.08,4.62,1.54,2.77,0.31,0.31,0.31,0,0,0,9.23,4.31,1.85,0.92,0.92,1.23,6.15,10.46,1.54,11.08,1.85,5.85,4,1.54,1.54,0,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.38,5.85,4,0.62,0,0,0,0.31,0,0,0,0.62

Without informing me, the same director cuts the funding for this project in January of the next year, as part of a budget reduction requirement. I find out the funding was cut in March of that year, when I submit the invoice from the client to the director's department for payment. We are one of over two hundred suppliers participating in the annual marketing project (yearly print catalog), where the client has already spent the money and asks for payment when the project is complete. We owe them over $75,000, too large an amount for me , or my manager, or my manager's manager to cover unexpectedly. I saved the September emails from the director outlining the agreement to fund this program. I now have to negotiate for the money to pay this invoice by combining funds from who-ever I can scrape them up from. The Director's stance is there is no money in the budget, my director's stance is there is no money in our budget, and my position is we owe the client the money we committed to. The marketing director has the discretion to evaluate returns from other projects, reduce or cut them, plus a certain amount of discretionary room in the budget. Managers are incentivized to come in under budget, so I believe this director sees this as a zero-sum game. I imagine the director feels caught between """" a rock and a hard place"""", because this person is typically empathetic, but taking a hard stance on """" we have no money to pay for this"""".

When I was about 17-18 I had a brief romance with a girl who was deeply troubled for a number of reasons. She struggled with addiction and PTSD, and I was dealing with traumas of my own. Sadly I made the choice to end things because I thought I was a bad influence on her, enabling her self destructive vices. Eventually she ended up with my brother for a time, who also struggled with addictions but had no qualms about enabling hers, in stark contrast to myself. This naturally blew up into a catastrophic conflict amongst the three of us. Ultimately this girl nearly killed herself at our home (my brother's and mine, that is). I wound up covered in her blood and watching an ambulance take her away after finding her having slit her wrist. The very same night I developed an intestinal blockage due to the stress of the situation as well as my underlying condition (Crohn's Disease), and ended up in the hospital as well. My brother and I barely spoke for years following that incident. I left home and went as far away as possible. It wasn't merely a simple case of my asshole brother stealing my girl. It was that she was someone I cared enough about that I left her because I honestly believed she'd be better off, and in every way I could've been bad for her he was magnitudes worse. It made me hate him like I'd never felt before. Seething hatred the likes of which I couldn't get a grip on. I never blamed her, though she thought I did for years.

No mater what I did or said, I could never get through to her and get her to realize the amount of stress and frustration I had with her, and the building contempt I had for her that eventually led to situations that led to our divorce.  During 3 years of back and forth attempts at reconciliation which included marriage counseling, she started to realize how much conflict her choosing to exclude me from the decision initially and her continued refusal to listen to me had caused.  It still took her almost the full 3 years to finally get a job, but by that point we were divorcing.  Having talked with her since, she now fully realizes and understands how what she assumed to be minor disagreements or her thinking I was being irrational lead to major breakdowns in our relationship.  She has often said now that she has to work full time and support herself, she now realizes the stress and frustration I was having over our financial situation and how it lead to some of the fights we would have.  .",313,31.73,95.15,32.11,3.87,28.45,18.85,94.57,61.02,20.13,15.65,4.15,3.83,0,7.67,0,4.47,4.47,14.06,8.95,6.71,8.95,0.96,17.25,3.51,2.24,1.92,1.28,1.28,2.88,0.32,2.56,0.96,1.28,0,19.49,3.51,0,9.27,0,13.1,4.79,3.51,1.28,2.56,0.32,1.6,0.96,0,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.78,6.07,1.92,4.15,1.6,0,9.27,8.63,0.64,16.61,3.19,6.07,8.31,3.51,0.32,0.96,0.96,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,7.35,3.83,3.19,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,0

We dated other people and were happy for a time, until I fell in love with someone else and was brought back to myself--ie: I was emotionally in touch again with the deep part of me that knew I was monogamous in my core. When I told my wife that I could no longer do an open marriage, she was devastated. She offered to be monogamous again, but I refused because I knew she was as polyamorous as I was monogamous. We separated three years ago and are finally going through a divorce. Our communicated has dwindled to almost nothing because she is so hurt--I think she feels that I have abandoned her. But I think we have different ideas about how to show up for each other now--I think because of her polyamory, she holds a more fluid definition of boundaries and would like to be closer than what I'm comfortable with as I'm in a new partnership.",260,24.86,42.37,92.44,47.08,21.67,18.85,91.92,61.92,24.23,18.85,11.54,2.69,0,4.62,0,5.38,3.46,15,10.38,3.85,8.08,1.92,19.62,6.15,5,1.15,0.77,2.31,4.23,2.69,1.54,0,0,1.54,14.23,3.08,0.38,5.77,0,17.69,6.15,1.92,2.69,1.54,0.77,5.38,2.31,0.38,0,1.92,0.38,0,0,0,0,9.23,6.92,0,1.92,0.38,0,10,7.69,0.38,13.85,1.15,6.92,6.15,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.69,4.62,3.46,0.38,0,0,0,2.31,0,1.92,0,0

I complained about it and could feel it moving slightly when I pressed with my tongue. He said he couldn't see it moving. I said well I can feel it and it's not right. He refused to believe me so I left and was so mad. A few weeks later it got so loose that there was no way he couldn't tell so I went back. He didn't say anything about not believing me before, but said he'd go ahead and fix it.

I said I didn't think he fit correctly. He said the crown is fine, it must've been my gums that """"dropped"""" lower when he put it on. So his """"fix"""" for that was to take his sharp tool and rough up my gums to stimulate them to bleed and rise up to fill the gap. I left there mad again, but he made me feel like I was the problem. A couple weeks later I went back because of course the gap was still there. He sighed and rolled his eyes at me and took filling material to fill in the gap next to the crown.  I still didn't think that was a good solution and questioned it, but he was getting agitated and kept sighing. A couple weeks later his patch of filling material fell off and I was too dejected about the whole thing to go back. I just let that crown be, with the small gap by my gums. About 2 years later that crown was again loose because of his shoddy work and I had another dentist check it out. He pulled it off and my tooth was completely rotten underneath.

He would make fun of people almost directly to their face, he was rude to servers and store employees. But, he was funny in a certain way, so we were sort of friends. Then one day when we were out to a restaurant he began to put down and make fun of other colleagues. I told him politely that I don't like to talk about that kind of stuff, and if you make fun of them, you are in a way, making fun of me. He continued with another sentence or two along the same lines. I told him literally """"yellow light"""" warning, stop making fun of my colleagues in my presence or I'm going to leave. He made excuses that he was only  talking about them, not me. I insisted that I consider myself part of that same group, and if he puts them down, he is putting me down. He continued. I said """"that's it,"""" grabbed my belongings, stood up, and left the restaurant.
