Said member was a sibling and they are older than me by 6 years.  When I would go to visit them they always wanted me to bring or buy something for me along the way.  This became a burden.

One time(of many) he wanted the crews to come in on the weekend to finish up a job so that we could get the paperwork finished up. when he made this decision it was over the phone and he was slurring his words from drinking so much. I called in the crews and told them to come in on Saturday. There was no need for them to come in. He believed that there needed to be an update sent out by monday afternoon but he did not know( i don't know why either) that the update for the work was due on the following thursday. So the crews came in for nothing. When i was at the site i went and typed up an email addressing why i thought his decision was wrong, how he wasn't in the right mindset to make the decision, that there was an alternate option and it would have produced the same thing without damaging his and my credibility to the crews. He got the email and wanted to sit down and talk. When we sat down he began quoting what i had written out of context to make me seem like i should have sought out his wisdom. I asked him to find in the email exactly where i gave him the impression i didn't know what i was doing. he then informed me he will find it, but he wasn't a quick reader and it might take a while. so i sat there quietly after work waiting for my boss to slowly read through the email until he gave up and compromised maybe it wasn't exactly as he remembered.",6,2,1,27,male,White,

They essentially removed a foreign power so they could be in control and called the local Filipinos as insurgents, but I found hypocritical because they were fighting for freedom. The United States has done a lot of beautiful things for the world, but also a lot of horrible things and a lot of it seems to be skewed or completely left out in our history books, which kind of makes me mad.

It should be noted that with one or two exceptions, everyone in our friend group has ADHD/ADD, so it was an understandable problem to have, but it became a larger issue when we had to delay a group activity we were organizing. A gift exchange took an extra week because M was slow to mail their gift (for clarity's sake, this wasn't on the post office; M waited until the last second to mail the package), and my partner and I felt it was unfair to everyone else, because we'd all made time and moved our schedules so we could open the gifts together. I have this priority about punctuality and trust: if someone tells me they will mail a letter and then they don't, I will begin to trust them less, especially if they make the same promise to me over and over without following through. I might start to trust them less with regards to other promises.



It felt like M wasn't aware of how their actions were affecting the group. They didn't publicly show any self-awareness of their issues with time management. My partner and I were hurt and impatient.

I also could not get over how she called them aliens. They are people and no human being, regardless of citizenship status, should be labeled as illegal or an alien. That is dehumanizing. Their value goes so much farther beyond their citizenship status. This is aside form the blatant racism when she assumed that they were illegal because they weren't white. That is not how you should be treating others. I try my best to love others and avoid any kind of judgment regardless of their actions, race, sexuality, or preferred gender.

It started out by them asking me to let them have the room to themselves for a little while because they’re introverted and need alone time. I thought this was a little weird, but agreed nonetheless because I didn’t want to create a bigger issue. Over time, they asked for increasingly more alone time, and would sometimes ask me to leave at night. This made me uncomfortable and I didn’t want to leave the room, but I didn’t want to stay in with a person who didn’t want me to be there. I adapted my behavior to spend as little time in the room as possible, which my ex-roommate proceeded to complain about. This made me very confused and frustrated because I didn’t want to be in a place I was frequently kicked out of, and it made me feel like I was not a person with my own personal needs, but an object that can be stored away and taken out when the user chooses. The tension and frustration began to build up until one night when I was kicked out yet again, I left in a passive-aggressive way that my ex-roommate later confronted me about.

I'd go home crying to my parents everyday, but the child wouldn't stop. One day, I got so fed up, I ultimately ended up punching the child on the shoulder and got myself into trouble. It was a learning experience, and I ultimately found out that ""two wrongs don't make a right"" in the most applicable way possible. These days, I've applied this concept in other parts of my life. I've come to confront people in ways that avoid physical contact if I am done wrong, and explain to them my feelings. I try to avoid doing the ""two wrongs"", but sometimes fall victim to it.

Our dish washer had just finished a cycle, and needed to be emptied out before we could put our newly dirty dishes from dinner in. My dad and I got to work. I thought it would be better to put dishes away in an assembly line-like fashion as the cabinets where the dishes belong are a couple steps away from the dishwasher. My dad thought it would be better for each of us to take a handful of dishes and carry them to the cabinets separately. We both must have had other things that we needed to be doing, because we ended up arguing about this throughout the whole cleaning process. Eventually, both of our stubbornness resulted in elevated voices (mostly on my part). I believe that I was feeling as if my dad thought he was right just because he was older. But to me, this was an incredible fallacy. My dad eventually just told me to finish cleaning on my own if I was going to keep arguing. After finishing, I remember walking to my room and slamming the door. Often, it's the little things that get me most riled up.

This was particularly concerning and strange because we had practically become brothers over our friendship and I had learned to tell when something was wrong (something was definitely wrong). This all culminated in a lengthy confrontation over text in which I told him that his relationship was obviously not healthy, he wasn't getting enough time with his friends and was being forced to spend all of his time with his girlfriend, that his girlfriend was incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive, and that I didn't want to even try to be friends anymore because it was so consistently exhausting and disappointing. Months later, according to one of our mutual friends that still talks to him, his situation has since declined even further in all the above-mentioned areas, but also especially following it coming out that his girlfriend cheated on him. The actual conflict of the situation was mostly internal for me, thinking about what I could've done to prevent it from happening, if I wasn't a good enough friend, etc. His mental and physical health continued to decline and as time went on I felt less and less guilty about his situation. It became apparent to me after piecing together years of his casual asides and buried family history that his disposition wasn't my fault, and the reason it had never improved was because he never received proper treatment and never improved his lifestyle.

A friend of mine had been lying to me about something very relevant for awhile.

Unfortunately, they were in denial, even though I had clear evidence that what they were lying about was true. This person continued to manipulate me and gaslight me, through the actions of crying and victimizing themselves. Unfortunately, I am an extremely empathetic person, so it was hard for me to not forgive them. However, after giving this person another chance, they continued to gaslight, manipulate, and lie to me. From this experience, I realized that I need to be the bigger person, and also put myself first.

Id hope she feels the same way for me. I think both of us needed time to cool off and now that we have I think we are on better terms. I think we would both feel awkward around each other in public.

Shorty after my roommate and I were over the prank and were confused why my brother was so upset. We all felt as if my brother was overreacting and I tried to diffuse the situation with him, but he made it larger. He told me that he felt as if I side with my roommates more than him, which I found confused, because my roommate and I were arguing because he did not agree with what I did. My brother is very emotional and he chose to not speak to me for a few days.

This happened to me two days days in a row with his cloths. So on the second day, I confronted him and told him that he should only do his laundry when he has the time to move it over and take care on it himself. He kept repeating about how busy he was and that it was hard to find a time to do it. This is true, he is in a difficult major that is time consuming and I'm sure he really feels that there is no other time to do it.

She had not been used to anyone standing up to her and I believe it came as a shock.

This is a conflict because I like to do this sometimes but we live together so we are usually home at the same time. She feels like I am picking weed over her sometimes.

At first I think it was really tough on her because she was a pretty reserved person and I know how she felt about me so to see her make that decision, to end things, for God, it made me rethink her relationship with God.

It was mostly a conflict of me and the rest of the house missing her being here with us. Basically, every weekend of this term she had left to go see her long-distance boyfriend. Sometimes she wouldn't even tell us she was leaving for the weekend until the moment she was getting ready to go. This really bothered us as a house, because we are all close friends and are pretty communicative with each other. Also, we missed hanging out with her on the weekends. When I would try to convince her to stay, she would find every excuse to make leaving us justifiable. I get why she would want to see him instead of us, since she sees us everyday, but we don't hang out much through the week because we have school and work.

This homosocial performance, as stated in lecture, is most successful when the man is able to act dominant and objectify women with his peers. If the peers don’t observe the behavior: the whole action becomes obsolete. My classmate during the discussion on this theory disagreed: stating that men are oppressed to think that the only way they could get the girl is by acting in this certain dominant manner: and that their friends were just kindly trying to help.

Maybe she was impatient because she was running late, considering she honked very quickly after the light turned green. After this, my boyfriend angrily threw his hand up, to ask why she honked. She then pulled up next to our car and started taking a video or photos of us. By now, she must have been angry because of my boyfriend throwing up his hand. After this she drove down a different street. My boyfriend and I were angry that she took footage of our faces, and did not get a photo of the license plate instead.

Part of me started to wounder if it was really worth sticking around because I am a person who respects people who are straight forwards and don't like people don't saying what they really think. I put a lot of myself into nurturing this bond but it hurt me feeling I wasn't receiving much back. Part of me feels selfish that feel like I put more effort in especially when things started.

The conflict was that my girlfriend had been distant and I had asked her a handful of times over a long period (maybe 6 months) what was going on, each time being very understanding and gentle. Everytime we talked about it she did not know how she felt, she just knew she had felt off. I think she was feeling self conscious with her personality because she was having a hard time making new friends and I also think she had some body image issues that may have been affecting our relationship as well. From my end, I felt I may have resorted to over compensating for her lack of being there by trying to talk all the time or by getting her things, basically just being too much in general. She would tell me it wasn't that but she still did not know how she felt. Eventually after these 6 months or so she broke down one day telling me she didn't feel good about our relationship and again I asked her how come and she did not know, she just knew she was feeling wrong about it and that she was ""losing interest"". My response was to try to stay calm and collected and try to understand more about how she felt because ""losing interest"" doesn't really have an easily understood definition. This conversation seemed to go in circles until she told me she just needed some space so we left the conversation there. Late that night I had been thinking about it and sent her a text explaining how I felt and why I needed her to help me understand how she was really feeling while also saying if she didn't know how she felt I was there to talk through it with her. The next morning she texted me to see if I wanted to come over to talk about it.

He got extremely defensive of the company, and it made it hard for me not to get angry. I know he likes his job and the benefits that he receives but him getting so fired up made me fired up as well.

While also, we both at the time were underage to even be drinking. Buddy was mentally probably fine. He had two beers over the span of four hours, but still there was no need to take such a risk. We argued and I said fine, i am not getting in the car, i will take an uber. We both ended up taking an uber home. It was a silent drive home.

Out family usually doesn’t close the bathroom door all the way and my mother did not know I was home yet. The bathroom light was on and the door was nearly closed, so I was mad at my mother for ignoring the signs that someone was in the bathroom and disturbing me in the middle of something private. I sternly said to close the door. She closed the door, but then she started yelling at me because I had not closed the door all the way and had not announced my presence to her when I came home from school.

I think my mother felt bad about yelling at me while I was just doing my business in the normal family manner; however, she never apologized. This leads me to believe that she felt so embarrassed that she was never able to admit to herself that the incidence could possibly have been her fault. For the most part, I believe my mother was not thinking very hard when she entered the bathroom, as she is often on autopilot.

Im sure she felt annoyed because taking the bus is never better than getting a ride to school. Cars are more comfortable and you do not have to deal with other people screaming or whatever. I am sure it was frustrating not being able to drive yourself to school as I dealt with the years prior when I did not have a license so I am sure she thought if only she had a license. I guess she probably also wondered why I would not take her because in her mind she is not annoying but to me very. She probably also did not agree with my choice.

By the time we were upperclassmen, we frequently argued over virtually everything, and soon the friendship was called off when she sent me a message about how I was a terrible person and put a damper on her and her ability to succeed in life. My best guess is that she never understood my perspectives in our arguments and never thought to think of what I was feeling.",4,4,3,19,female,White,

I informed my mother that I had to work on this night, and she was not happy about it because she wanted someone to be home to be with my sister. I thought this was not a fair expectation because my sister is no longer a child, and she is old enough to either be home alone, or make alternative plans for herself. My mother thought that this was disrespectful and that the burden of finding what to do with my sister would now fall on her, and she is already busy. I think in my mothers eyes I was creating more issues than i was solving by choosing to work on a day that she was working. She was upset that I did not take her schedule into consideration more when planning for myself.

I was (and still do) use the internet as an escape from my life. It led to multiple disagreements, some ending in yelling on my part and retreating into herself on my mothers. Also huge amounts of anxiety for us both, sometimes would both of us ended up crying though I didn't notice her crying unless I looked really closely at her eyes and saw the tears. At the beginning of this conflict, my mom saw my internet consumption as a waste of time and a detriment to my motivation. I could/ can see her point, however, the internet consumption was much more complicated than she realized. It is a habit I learned in middle school as a way to shut out the world, my feelings and my parents fighting. My mother only realized this later. When the conflict first begin, she thought I could easily stop and was just being lazy by choosing to remain on the computer. She only noticed after my dad had left which made me feel that if she hadn't cared much before so why did she care about it now. I definitely had some issues at the time with trusting and sharing my feelings. However, as the years and clashes went on, I became better at articulating my feelings. We had many discussions and she came to realize there was more to my internet use than she thought. Yes it was sometimes detrimental to my sleep and mental health but it was also a product of my mental health- a habit that will probably take years to correct. She still thinks its bad I spend so much time on the computer (I go back and forth) but she understands the reasoning. Our communication and detailed discussions and sometimes extreme anger on my part (which I am very thankful has disappeared since I left home) led to a better understanding of each other's feelings and a resolution to the conflict.

This has caused conflict when I want to turn off the light to sleep and he wants to keep it on to do whatever he is doing. I usually just stay up a little longer, until about midnight, and than we turn it off as a middle ground for both of us. I think he appreciates this middle ground because he would like to stay up longer. At the start of the year this was a much bigger issue because it was knew for both of us and caused resentment. Over time though we've both realized it's okay to have this compromise so we both get what we want. I sometimes still want to turn off the light earlier but I realize that he wants to keep it on so I don't say anything. I imagine he has the same thoughts when we do turn it off, but he doesn't voice them either.

It was a lot of small things building up. Eventually, we just went back to the hotel for dinner. I think both of us had an opinion, but didn’t want to say it, so neither of us were happy.

I was in my room while this was happening, and it was until three days later when I realized my aunt stayed in her room for three days.

Separately, I had to talk to my mother and my aunt to understand both of their perspectives. As much as I would prefer to be the neutral voice in this situation, my mom was clearly in the right. My aunt has a history of overreacting and turning herself into the victim, so I was not surprised she acted this way.

I felt very bad about it but it had to be resolved. I think the other person was fairly shocked and upset but did a good job of covering up their emotions. They continued to talk to me as normal despite hearing bad news. I think they did this as to avoid further conflict or problems. I think they acted as I would have because I am typicallt non controversial and conflict intimidates me.

I had played basketball and soccer with the girls in this friend group since kindergarten.  Throughout the years they increasingly excluded me from group activities and began bullying me.  One girl in particular who will be named R, was the ring leader in my misery.  I had struggled with confidence due to R's actions and words.  After years of being put down, I realized there was no reason for me to simply stick through this long ""friendship"" we had created.  Thus, deciding I needed to stand up for myself, I left the friend group and made many new quality friends.  In the beginning, R would not let me leave so easily, she spread rumors and went out of her way to manipulate the ways people perceived me.  Her actions lead me to believe she felt the need to maintain power over me, to control and bully me like she had for years.  As I created stronger bonds with my new friends, R became jealous and hated me.  I became more confident with myself and cut her negative energy off completely.

I think he was overwhelmed with school at the time, and not in a good mindset. He kind of grew distant from our friend group but would never say what was wrong. Even if he was coming up with excuses to not put effort into school, I don't think I helped him by arguing.

This girl spread this false rumor about me to most of the school, and even caused my boyfriend, at the time, to consider breaking up with me (but he didn't).  I've done a lot of thinking about this experience and my honest opinion is that this girl who used to be really close with me wanted more status in the school, and my other two friends hadn't been paying enough attention to her at the time, and that's why she decided to spread the rumor. I think she wanted me out of the friend group so she could gain the trust of the other two girls.  One thing that really bothered me about this situation, other than the fact she spread the rumor and people believed it, was that I was the only person in the friend group who gave her real, authentic advice and love, while the other two girls were always picking on her.  I was always there for her during hard times, and it shocked me that she chose popularity over authenticity.  I think this girl regrets her decision now, because people later found out the rumor wasn't true, but it wasn't until after my high school graduation that people realized she had lied about it.

The whole situation was very uncomfortable and quite frustrating for me.

At the dinner we both at the same time got a text from my mom saying how mad she is about the mess. Immediately my brother assumes that I had thrown him under the bus and also thinks that my mess was worse because I had more people over. He gets really angry and starts cussing and saying I betrayed him and then he starts reading the text. Halfway through him reading the text I start finishing the sentences and then I say the exact time the it was sent to his because I knew it was the same time I got it. We had been yelling at each other for a while but after that he realized his mistake. He didn’t apologize for being so aggressive and mean though but I think it was because he felt embarrassed since he is older then me yet was in the wrong.,7,1,4,18,male,White,

So we walked further down the dock and into the dark so no one would see us. My friend then decided it would be a good idea to pull out her phone and take a flash photo of me peeing, so a bright light was shining on me squatting and peeing in the pitch black. I was so embarrassed cause 20 feet away was my whole high school class that just saw me peeing. I was so mad and embarressed I ran away. She ran to find me and she didn't understand what she did wrong or why I was upset and was just laughing about it while I was upset. I went the whole party not talking to her because I was so embarrassed and people were coming up to me asking if I was the person squatting with my pants at me knees at the end of the dock. She had no idea what she did wrong. It was so frustrating.",7,1,5,18,female,White,

He said what he did isn't cheating because we weren't ""dating"", but he would take me to meet his family, have dinner at his house, and then tell me he loves me all the time. I say it is cheating because we were exclusive and going on dates. I stopped talking to him for a month or so because of this. He really hurt me. Eventually he begged for me to be in his life again, instead of not communicating at all. I don't care what he thought or felt because he was a jerk and whatever he felt didn't matter to me because clearly how I felt was irrelevant to him. I allowed us to be friends with him again, which was a mistake honestly. He still thinks what he did was wrong but ""not that bad"".",7,1,2,18,female,"hispanic, latinx, or spanish origin",

From my perspective, she has not been aware or caring of my needs as a human being (ie. sleep, privacy, etc.). In one instance, she refused to turn off her light at midnight and continued to talk on her phone loudly with a friend while I was trying to sleep when I had a test in a class the next morning. I have come to her many times to express how I am feeling and my perspective, also wanting to hear her perspective of things. Often, she tells me that she is not aware of the fact that she is not being considerate of my needs. Some of her behavior has changed after I talk to her about the situations, but some of her behavior remains the same. I have been fairly open and transparent with where I am at with my tolerance of this behavior in terms of my own needs, but she is not open with me about issues she may have with me. She has only talked to me once, and during that time, she started with yelling at me, and I needed to calm her down and set boundaries with the conversation before it escalated any further. I understand that it can be difficult to share such a small space with another person who you haven't known for that long, but from what I understand about other people's situations with their roommates, mine tends to be the most problematic.",6,2,5,18,female,White,

She was probably feeling extremely hurt and betrayed, as did I. At the time, I also had a boyfriend and the situation put a strain on our relationship. I was so caught up with my anger toward her for staying with her boyfriend afterward, that I forgot to consider the other feelings going on in her head. I had felt like the victim of the situation, but I think everyone involved got hurt. A few months later, her boyfriend sexually assaulted me. I was so scared and hurt that it took me three months to get up the nerve to finally tell her. She had been emotionally abused and toyed with by her boyfriend, so she continued to stay with him which caused the end of our friendship. Since then my friend has made realizations and we have reconnected in college. Her boyfriend has never taken into account our feelings the way we did with each other, leaving my best friend and I stronger and him out of the picture.",6,2,5,18,female,White,

He probably pondered what he said, and felt some regret. I, on the other hand, didn't think about it and moved on, awaiting an apology. I am not the type of person to hold a grudge over someone,, but I believe if someone does or says something wrong then it's their responsibility to apologize for that action. So, after a few days, I finally awoke to an apology from him. After reading it a few times, it was obvious the apology was an incomplete one. It consisted of partial blame on me. I, however, wanted to drop the issue, so I told him thank you for apologizing and we moved on. I had, in all stages of the conflict, conferred with my best friend for advice on how to handle the issue. Ultimately, we decided it would be best not to escalate things. Overall, I was satisfied with how I handled it, and I think my friend regretted what he said, and was satisfied with his apology, though I wasn't 100%.",7,2,5,18,male,White,

Since I've always had issues trusting my dad before the second time, when I found out, I didn't know how to react. First I was mad and venting about my frustrations to him, but then I soon got over it because I realized he didn't deserve my attention. I still haven't talked to him in over 6 months but I plan on keeping it that way because my life is better without him. I might talk to him again one day but as of now, I don't see a need to. My dad probably is upset I won't talk to him because he texts me and sends me care packages but I don't respond to him at all. But I do think he understands why and knows that I just need time.

We ended up having a conversation where I told her I didn't want to live with her because I wanted to have some separation from my boyfriend and didn't want to complicate things if one of us broke up. She is very emotional and irrational (one of the many reasons I didn't want to live with her) and told her boyfriend I was a bad friend and I ""never apologized"". Which isn't true. I told her I was really sorry when we talked and she seemed to totally understand. Her boyfriend told mine that I needed to treat her better, which is causing conflict everywhere because my boyfriend is being forced to choose between me and his best friend.

Then, when we went back to our dorm (we live in the same hall) she just got up and left, even though we were going to do the homework together. So I thought I would wait for her to come back. Two hours later she comes back with one of her friends that I am not fond of. I figured that the friend was having a hard time so I just brushed it off. Then, my friend took the textbook from me while I was working on the homework. I figured that she would give the book back to me when she finished the problem but she just ignored me and finished the entire homework section without me. As a result, an hour later I was able to do the homework after she had finished. I knew she could tell that I was annoyed and later when she texted me I was passive aggressive.

She took this as me being clingy, so after that she did not feel the same way as I did about our friendship. After winter break she told me she was going to be moving out of the room and into the other friends room, to see what it was like living with her as a trial run for next year. Little did I know this was only a excuse because those last couple of weeks she lived in the room we did not talk at all and it was very awkward. My RA decided it would be best if we had a 1 on 1 discussion and when that happened the truth came out. During the last few weeks I thought she hated me for something I did but come to find out, nothing was my fault, but it was her own personality that made it that was because she was having a hard time adjusting and mashing with my type of personality.",6,3,5,18,female,White,

I don't like asking my partner to stop talking to people or become a little distant with someone because I feel like I would be controlling them and I truly believe that people should have their own freedom as individuals. The reason why asked him to do that was because I felt very insecure knowing that they talk a lot since I know how much she means to him, and also, he had previously broke-up with me a couple of months prior to this argument. Once we had fixed our relationship, he confessed to me that he wasn't completely over her. All this, for some reason, made me feel very insecure and during our argument I explained to him my emotions, as well as letting him know that I felt like a second option, or a replacement. He would keep saying that I don't trust him (which I do but not when it comes to her and he knows it) and that I shouldn't ask to stop talking to her because they are just friends. He also mentioned that he wouldn't comply with what I was asking, nor become a little distant with her. I think he felt untrusted and like I was not listening or keeping in mind what he had said. I know that he was mad at me during this argument, but he never explained to me the reasons. He probably also felt like the argument was somewhat unnecessary, should not have been brought up in the first place and the topic should not interfere or be a problem in our relationship.",6,4,3,18,female,"hispanic, latinx, or spanish origin",

At this point, I hung out with him like every weekend and we were in the process of becoming super good friends. I didn't realize it made her sad and I guess I was paying more attention to him than my other friends. That was because I was excited to have more friends that I hadn't already known since kindergarten. She said that I was changing my identity so I would have more similarities to my guy friend which now that I think about it could have been a little true but I was also in the process of trying to find out who I was in my own mind.

About a year after we had started the quartet, the sax player wanted to switch instruments from sax to piano. He also wanted to start a new group with him playing piano.

I argued that he'd already put so much time into getting good at saxophone and working up our group and that he shouldn't throw it all away. He argued that he enjoyed playing piano more than saxophone. He also, at the peak of our fight, said that he would soon be a much better pianist than I was. The drummer sided with the saxophone player, and so they both left our group to start their own group without me. Now I was very angry at both of them. A year passed where I said barely a word to the saxophone player - the only time we talked was when we insulted each other's piano playing. When he left for college (to major in jazz piano), I regretted our friendship falling apart. I came to one of his concerts, and we had a long discussion afterwards where we both apologized and agreed to meet up later. Since then, we've become good friends again, and we've even played a concert together where we both played piano (kind of like a four-hand ragtime thing).

She felt like she had done nothing wrong the whole night and I felt like she was being disrespectful of my wishes when I told her she had to sleep at the foot of the bed.

When he began yelling at me for such a simple thing I got really frustrated and began wrestling with him on the floor.

Furthermore, his resistance to giving up this friendship allowed for a violent, dangerous person to continue to be close to our lives. I also think that his choice to remain friends with him signaled to other men in his friend group that it was okay to continue this friendship and thus resulted in normalizing violent behavior. He felt as though I was blaming him for the actions of his friend and that because he did not participate in the assaults that he was free of all responsibility. He also expressed that it was unreasonable of me to expect him to give up a life-long friendship “over one night of actions”. He continued to defend his position by explaining how as a Christian his belief was to forgive his friend and that he reflected with God who told him to not abandon his friend in his time of need. He also maintained that his friend’s actions only occurred because of the presence of alcohol.

Every time they're alone, he hits her with a line like ""I'm so depressed"", you could make me so happy"", or ""Let's just skip the talking, and skip to kissing"". Grade A douchery. Meanwhile she's got her head in her hands, like shit I feel so bad, I don't wanna hurt his feelings, I don't wanna mess up the friend group, am I being a jerk, really torn up. The question is, was he aware he was hurting her, or did he think it was all like a flirty game that secretly excited her? Regardless, I don't tolerate that shit. I wanted to rip him to shreds - verbally, at least. But the thing is she was too timid and docile to let that happen. When he confronted her for being a tease, he made her promise not to tell anyone else, so I had to pretend that I didn't know what I knew. Which meant I had to play nice with him, hang out, etc. because ultimately it's her decision even if she's irrationally self-hating. So that's what I did, but I slowly stopped to talking to him over the course of a few months. Now I barely see him but still smile. Still fills me with unexpressed rage. Oh, also, I started dating Lily, so maybe that'll show him? Haha",7,1,3,,,,
1a,533,pt,"During softball season my co-captain/best friend and I feuded with this girl Reagan who was a year below us. My best friend, Savvy, and Reagan started fighting our sophomore year over a boy and they fought all junior softball season. Then mine and Savvy's senior year, Reagan was a junior, our coach said that there wouldn't be captains this year when he had always had captains. My best friend and I were overqualified. I started playing softball as a freshman and made it to starting varsity my junior year while being an IB student with above a 4.0 and graduated as Salutatorian while working and volunteering and Savvy had been on varsity since senior year and helped the team a lot over her years. We met with our coach and he said that we couldn't be captains because it would upset other people (he wasn't allowed to say names of any individuals not present) but we knew he was talking with Reagan. She kept making our lives miserable but we convinced our coach that we should be captains and not Reagan and that her opinion/reaction should not dictate what I am deserving of. We had to get parents involved. The entire rest of the season we had to deal with a feud between me and savvy with Reagan and it made the season horrible. She always wanted to be better than us and always wanted the team to see her as superior so she always talked down on us and told everyone on our team to not listen to us or follow us ever. I honestly don't know what was going through her head. I think she was scared that our coach would like us more (he never did) just because he saw him as a father figure because her father wasn't in her life. As well, I think she was scared that the younger/new players would see that Savvy was a better player than her and not go to her for help. Ever since the fight over the boy Reagan and Savvy always feuded and I think since they've just been fighting over who is better and got others involved in their drama.",7,1,5,,,,
1a,534,pt,One conflict I have experienced is when my friend tried to romantically pursue another one of my friends ex romantic partners. I told my friend that she had did this and she confronted her. I dragged myself into the conflict and my friend was angry with me for telling our friend what she did. It ended up being a very awkward and uncomfortable experience but did not end our friendships. My friend who tried to get with her ex was mad that it had been found out. She also was mad at herself for what she did. I felt bad that the whole situation happened. My other friend was sad and confused. We all learned to be more honest with each other. It was a very unnecessary conflict that was resolved.,3,2,6,,female,White,

Paul was never very nice to people who didn't fit into his specific social group or ideals about what was 'cool' or 'normal'. Unfortunately, this included myself and my friend, let's call him Ian. Ian and I got along very well because we had a similar sense of humor and really didn't try to act like people we're not. This made us perfect targets for Paul. Now while I don't remember exactly what Paul said that day in class, I do know that it was some degrading/ mocking remark about Ian. That day, I finally said something: ""You know what Paul? You can make fun of me but you don't get to make fun of my friends! What you're doing not only reflects badly on you, but the people you surround yourself with. You should be ashamed of yourself"". When I said that, I am fairly confident that Paul was shocked into submission because he didn't say anything after that. I doubt he believed that I would actually stand up to him, but I did and I hope he remembers it.",6,2,5,,,,

She believes that because there is nobody else in the house that would have taken it, it had to have been me, without consulting anybody else first. She stated that since we often share a lot of our other personal belongings that I thought it would be ok to share food as well. I was not even aware that she had anything in the fridge and had not opened the fridge/cooked anything in the past couple days. My sister felt mainly confused rather than angry or upset since I typically wouldn't do something like this, but she couldn't think of any other person that would have taken it.",6,2,4,,,,

I've avoided talking to her about her or my life due to this experience. I barely see her during the day now and we don't really hang out anymore. I'm assuming she is dealing with something beyond the surface. This could maybe be a difficult transition or something at home happening. Or maybe she's having a hard time adjusting to college.

He wanted to message them to try and smooth things out between them,  but I told him he should wait and to give it more time because she just needs time to heal. However, he was very adamant about it saying he felt guilty and he just really wanted to make things up to her. I think he did really want to make things up to her and to rectify his mistakes in their friendship, but he wasn't really thinking about her feelings either and how she needed time to process it all. I kept telling him no and he was getting annoyed at me, saying that I was on her side and that I was just trying to sabotage their friendship. I think it was just his guilt coming out in the wrong way and since I was the only one there he was talking to in the moment, I ended up being the one he was taking his emotions out on. It hurt, and we had to take a day or two I think to talk again. I found out later that he did talk to her after we had finished our little conflict. Her and him were talking, but were still quite tense around each other and needed someone else when they were in person as to dispel the awkward air between the two. We both apologized to each other and recognized that both sides had their pros and cons to the approach and we both just talked about how glad we were that things did end up working out.

1a,569,pt,"A conflict that I have had with someone has been when trying to find a face mask. The other person who used it last said that they had put it in their dresser, but when I went to go look for it, it wasn't there. This went on for awhile because  as someone who frequently loses things, I hate losing things and I wanted to use the face mask for my skin as soon as possible. I think that the other person feels  not as attached to the face mask as I am because I have oily skin and the other person has dry skin, and the face mask is for more oily skin, so they would not use the mask as frequently. I think that they also think that they don't think that the product is that important because there are multiple face masks around our house that would do the same function. I just wanted that specific one because it works the best with my skin and one of my favorite products. When I did ""find""  the mask, it was the same product in a different container. It turned out that they had their own travel sized version of the product while I was looking for the larger, communal container. It is not that big of a conflict, but it is really frustrating to me because I really wanted to use the product at the time and we frequently share products with each other, and I couldn't use it at that time.",4,4,3,,,,

She always accuses me of never sharing my things, even though she is the same way, I just ask for her stuff less often. It makes me mad to be accused unfairly like this. Another reason I don't share is that she has a long history of losing or breaking my personal possessions. I don't ever accuse her of being careless, though. Still, it makes my sister angry that I won't give her my things even when I am not currently using them.

The conflict came from the fact that I had sexual relations with a mutual friend of ours, once or twice. Once he found out he, a very religious man, told me to go to hell and all sorts of nasty, mean remarks. I understand that he was hurt and probably felt overlooked and wondered why I didn't choose him as a partner. I do wish I could apologize as there were times I wasn't very nice to him and I can imagine the hurt he must have felt after finding out I had relations with our friend as I am not friends with that person anymore, but I think it was probably best the way things have turned out with us going our separate ways, as I couldn't offer him what he was looking for and he didn't have what I was looking for.",5,3,4,21,female,White,

I was a little frustrated because 40 minutes is much different from 10, and I'd have gone to sleep had I known it would take that long. I didn't want him to feel pressured to call me, because his family takes priority. My issue was that he gave me a 10 minute window and didn't stick to it or revoke it. He was frustrated because He felt like he would have lost either way: whether he'd said 10 minutes or not. It was a misunderstanding, because I would have been fine if he had said he wouldn't be around to chat for a while. I'd have gone to sleep.

Since my Tourettes was a recent diagnosis, my mom didn't fully understand it. Once I started having tics she got mad thinking I was trying to get out of being punished. She said some hutful things like ""Its all in your head"", which doesn't make sense because that's the definition of a neurological disorder and I think she was trying to say I was faking. Anyways, this was a really stressful time for my mom having to deal with my new diagnosis. She may have felt responsible and confused. When it came to my homework, I was doing slightly worse but it is hard dealing with new and scary situations like anxiety, depression, and tourrettes. I think my mom was scared that I wouldn't be able to achieve my academic goals because of this new and confusing situation.",5,3,6,19,female,White,

I was upset that they were moving slowly in practice and not trying, which lead to the whole team getting punished. As someone during this time who was always trying my hardest in practice, I was completely dumbfounded and started yelling at him. His counterargument was that it's just a game and just for fun, and I agreed with that but I also felt that it helped build discipline for yourself. Despite our differences, you normally got along, and after this he did appear to be trying slightly harder during practice. But for about a week conversations between us were pretty on edge, so I believe it is clear that they felt some kind of resentment towards me for that week. After a week things went back to normal, but with him still trying harder overall. So I think I gave him an extra push, and in the beginning he disliked it, but in the end he ultimately appreciated it.",5,3,5,20,male,"hispanic, latinx, or spanish origin",

Apparently she smelled the marijuana from her bedroom window and then confronted me while I was trying to sleep. I tried to explain to her how it is legal and I do it to help me sleep. She is from an older generation so she was not in the mood for rational thought. She still held the viewpoint that marijuana is terrible and no son of her's could ever do DRUGS. She was trying to come up with a consequence for my actions and I just told her ""Mom I'm literally 20."" I attempted to compare my nightly weed smoking with her nightly wine binge but that did not help my situation at all. The conflict is now over however my mom now knows about my small vice.

He also clarified to me that ""don't I know Blue Lives matter and Mexican lives matter and ALL lives matter"" I listened to him yell at me and tried to contain my deep hatred and distain for this persons opinions and treatment of me and honestly service workers as a whole. After he said his piece I stepped back a bit because we are in the middle of a pandemic and I didn't want him so close to me. He then made fun of me for not wanting to stand so close and jokingly said "" oh yea and of course you think I have covid right"". I responded to him saying that ""These are the views of the owners and this company and thats just how it is"". He paused for a moment and then stormed off. I believe he genuinely felt upset and angry about the BLM signs. I don't think he specifically felt any anger towards me or anyone working there in particular but I think he wanted an outlet for his anger. I think he probably feels as though excluding all other races or... job positions? Was offensive to him. I also think he probably was echoing a lot of what he was personally seeing in the media.I think we probably felt equal amounts of hatred towards one another's opinions.

They also thought that being gay was fine as long as they didn't act upon it. I thought that what they were thinking was ridiculous and not equal at all. Whether something is in the bible or not shouldn't mean anything in politics. We have separated church and state so it shouldn't determine whether something is legal or not. I was angry that this person thought this and that they only cared about their well-being and not others. That this person cared more about a word than having equal rights among people.

The very next day she then went and told some of my other friends what I had told her and they came up to me one day and asked if what she told them was true. I wasn't so much mad that the secret was out but more so that she disregarded that I had asked her to not tell anyone and she turns around and tells people. I was upset at first that she had betrayed my trust but then I got really mad at myself and at her. When I confronted her I let anger and rage control what I said, so things went off the rails real quick and it was more about letting her know my rage and not so much about trying to resolve things. Sure, now that I look back I could have handled things better but we were really young at the time and didn't know better and the me now would have definitely done things different. I don't think she had any remorse for what she did, it was just some silly thing that she did because when I confronted her at the time she just laughed it off and had no regard towards my feelings. I thing she might feel or get defensive of her actions as if she did nothing wrong and that I was being ""overdramatic"", it was just some harmless joke.

This started a huge fight and we ended up not talking all through high school. We reconnected in college and talked about what happened. She felt like I shoved her aside and that all of the years of our childhood didn't mean anything anymore. On my end, I just had lots of friends and had to learn how to balance my time with all of them. I never ignored her I just would hangout with other people.

We were both baffled by the fact that we thought we did not want to hang out with each other.

She was telling them I did not want to hang out when in reality she was not telling me that they were hanging out in the first place.

HE understood, but was being very passive aggressive about it and I could tell he was upset by the news. He did not really grasp the point we were trying to make because he thought that I was just trying to make him not go. That was not the case and was in fact the opposite of what I wanted.

I was fined $200 for drinking in the house, when everyone in the house openly drinks. I don't get along with people in the house very well because my ideals are different, I'm ""too hippy"" for them. I think that the board probably felt like they had to uphold a standard of living in the house.

I pushed her head out of the way so that I could leave and we had a short fight. Luckily her boyfriend was there to break up the fight. I ended up repaying her for the rent I owed and moved out shortly after the fight. We never talked again. I think she felt hurt and surprised that I was willing to physically assert myself.

It is a complicated dispute that occurred over the course of almost two years, but all stemmed from the same issue at hand. My mom’s mental health was negative and harmful, as she was experiencing depression, anxiety, and suicidal attempts. Our conflict was about her adverse actions surrounding herself and myself. In this paper, I am going to map the contributions to this conflict, taking into account everyone’s interests and personality.  When mapping out my side of this conflict and interests, I can understand this conflict better. My side in this conflict were for her to acknowledge, respect, and listen to my boundaries, and her to love me. In my conflict, I was scared to mention how frustrated I was that she would be with my friends without me because I did not want her repercussions. She would escalate the conflict by giving me the silent treatment, guilt-tripping me, and threaten me. Contrarily, when considering my mother’s side, I can see that she just wanted to have people around so she could feel less lonely. My dad was out of town traveling a lot for work, and mom did not have many friends. While in high school, my mom would put herself into my life by going to concerts, hanging out with my friends, and getting them food, sometimes all without me. In addition, my mom was suffering from mental illnesses, which caused her to act out. This is a physiological and psychological occurrence that affects your whole being. She takes medicine to regulate her thyroid due to it being removed because of cancer. During this time, her medication was wrong, and she was not receiving the correct dosage.

Sometimes I feel as though I don't feel appreciated or loved from him because I don't always receive that type of attention from him. I understand that he shows his love for me in other ways, but it would be nice to receive affirmative actions or words that show his affection.

From the topic of trans people, we moved to another political topic, the wealth distribution and the inherit racism at play. He argued that white privilege doesn't exist and that it is wealth that determines privilege, I agreed with him there but pointed out that from the start, white people were set at an advantage. He agreed at the beginning there was an advantage that white people had, but it is now gone because the country has progressed, I didn't and still don't think he is racist or has racist views because of the debate. He didn't try to talk down to me in the debate despite my age, he spoke to me as an equal trying to understand the point of view of my generation.

We reached a discrepancy about one of the rhythms in the piece. I was certain that it went one way, but she insisted that that was incorrect. I kept on arguing, and as we clapped it out to the beat I was still sure I was correct. (I didn't mention it to her, but I even remembered my band director pointing out that same rhythm in class, reaffirming my stance.) But she refused to relent, and even brought up that she had a music degree to insist that she couldn't be wrong. I gave up and just started playing the rhythm her way. I'm still certain that I was correct and I continued to play it the correct way outside of her lessons, but I couldn't stand up to her any more. It was really distressing to have her completely shut me down like that.

One of those friends I am super close to and has been there for me in the past, so I valued her friendship enough to tell her how I felt. She was very understanding and apologized. She didn't speak out to the group about inviting me because she was unsure about an existing conflict in the group with another friend and didn't want to complicate things. I believe she felt guilty and regretful of not speaking out after I explained how I felt. I prepared to cut my losses with the other two friends as I was not as close with them, they hadn't been there for me in the past, and I likely wouldn't see them in the future. They both found out I was feeling this way through another friend and both reached out to apologize. Their apology showed me that they do in fact care about me, and to me that was more important than the conflict itself. I believe they also felt guilty and regretful of not inviting me before.

However, as I arrived home my dad was waiting for me. I was 16 at the time, but I had an immense desire to be independent and separate from my family. Although I can look back and laugh at such a phase, it was difficult for myself and my family. My father and I soon got into a heated argument after I got home so late. I was extremely angry at the time, so I only saw his anger. However, looking back on the situation I realize his true feelings. My parents have always been excessive worriers, but essentially they want their children to be as safe as possible. I know he was worried about my safety when I didn’t come home.

I said the Kansas city Chiefs will win the superbowl. My facts to this argument was that they made it last year and beat my 49ers in the Super Bowl. There are many NFL announcers saying how much of a better team the Kansas city Cheifs are compared to the Packers. He then compared the wide receivers saying that the packers have pro bowl wide receivers. My counter arguments to that was the Chiefs had a sufficient amount of wide receivers. They also have the best tight end to ever live, Travis Kelce, he broke the record of all tim receiving yards from any tight end ever. I explained this showed how much depth the chiefs have compared to the Packers.

It never comes to personal attacks, it always stays on topic. He does get worked up easily, without any provocation, just by explaining my disagreement. He is very passionate about his views, so I have to make sure not to continue the conversation, and sometimes actively stop him from working himself up too much. I think that he knows that I'm not trying to make him angry, although I don't think he is completely aware of how much, easily, and quickly he gets worked up, and how most of that is just working himself up.

That is often an issue for my mom. I understand where her feelings are coming from because she cares so much and doesn't want to have to share my sister and I with our dad.

My friend is a person who doesn't necessarily mesh well with all people. I knew that she was really enjoyed being apart of the club and wanted the position. One of the hardest things about being a co president (which my friend and I both agree upon) is distinguishing who is serious about the club when we don't know them, which makes it hard giving people positions since we don't know who is going to step up or not.

They did not understand why this school was as important as it was to me. I think they were not thinking about the meaningful aspects, and only thought about what ""made most sense"" to them.

Preparations were made, and it looked like things were going well. However, a week before my friend was going to ask his crush, he changed his mind and sent a bunch of text messages to her friends calling her a slut, whore, etc. I was mad at my friend for not expressing his true feelings to this girl sooner and for damaging the relationship between families, and I let him know this.

When I was at work one morning, the door to our front house was left unlocked by one of them and someone was able to walk inside and steal my laptop off of the dining room table. I was pretty angry and frustrated with my roommates for being so careless and not offering to help me buy a new one, even though I felt it was partially their fault that it was able to be stolen. We had a house meeting about it and during that meeting one of roommates became very defensive. She was visibly annoyed and angry that I was bringing up how I felt about their role in the situation. I think that in that situation she felt that I was trying to unreasonably ascribe blame to them, and in a sense ¨taking out my anger on them¨ by repeatedly bringing it up and asking questions about what went on that day. She said some things to me along the lines of ¨I know you´re upset, but it´s not our fault.¨ I felt like she was sort of misrepresenting how I was addressing the situation, trying to characterize my communication with them about why this needed to be addressed as fueled by anger and the need to blame someone. It generally felt like the three of them were all trying to recount the events of that morning in a way that guaranteed that they hadn´t been the one to have left the door unlocked. I wasn´t trying to be aggressive about it but I was frustrated, confused and upset, and the situation felt very unresolved.

Later on, we reached out to each other to talk some things out. They stated quite plainly that I had changed since entering my relationship, and they didn't think it was good for me. Of course, I was quite opposed to their assertion and I vehemently denied it. After some exchange, we decided to take a break and think things out, which I spent thinking about what was said.

Looking at his side, he probably thought I was like every other liberal that is clouded by others opinions because I feel like that is what most republicans see liberals as.

I wonder if even if I saw danger though, if I would have reacted the way she did and I don't think I would have. She was seriously mad, but that goes with her character. In my head it was kinda funny how offended she got, so I made this comment that I wouldn't think she would take very seriously. I said, ""that gave me Karen vibes"". After pausing she told me she didn't like being called or described as ""karen"" and I was honestly scared. I was not ready for her to get upset at me. I responded by making two points: one was that I noted what she said and wouldn't do it again and another was that I clarified that I wasn't calling her ""karen"" I was just saying that what she said gave me karen vibes.

I know in that moment she was mad at me for putting my opinion on their relationship. I know she was thinking about how she shouldn't have told me about their arguments. She of course was probably feeling sad as well because of the overall situation and hearing things she didn't want to hear as it came out of my mouth. Frustration did show in her face and voice as well when she said ""Never mind lets not talk about it anymore."" Whenever I do bring it up like, ""How are you guys doing?"" she answers with ""Fine,"" or ""It's all good.""

This issue has come up quite a few times between my parents and I, however we have yet to resolve it. We go back and forth and oftentimes I just stop and agree with my parents because I am too nervous to actually tell them firmly how I feel and what I want. For me, I feel very let down and anxious about the situation because I really would like to go to California. I also don't want to disappoint my parents.

Her reasoning is that she has only been with me while I'm somewhere in the 20s with my partners. While I can understand her concern with not experiencing more in life, it definitely made me feel inadequate and like she was trying to make me a cuck. I'm sure that she didn't feel that way when she brought it up to me, nor do I think that she would have if she had know how it had impacted me tbh. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel, and I think I was able to get it across, but I think she has a difficult time empathizing in a non-selfish manner because she never has had a real relationship before. Ironically, one of my exes contacted me shortly after asking to be friends. I think that the emotions she felt when I told her what happened expanded her perspective on it.

1a,1223,pt,"A recent conflict I had was when I told my dad I was quitting baseball. This announcement led to him being extremely angry and disowning me as a son, which felt like an overreaction. To be fair I told him the day before the season was about to start that I didn't want to play anymore, so this element of surprise probably blindsided him a little bit. Since it was so surprising I'm sure he didn't know what to think, which led to a natural response of anger and lashing out. The conflict heightened as he began verbally abusing me and telling me my reasons weren't valid. This led to me arguing back and trying to make him understand that it wasn't something I wanted to do anymore and he had little say in the matter. Unsurprisingly this made the conflict turn physical as he tried to push me and physically threaten me. While I understand where his anger came from, as baseball is an important part of his identity and his connection to me, the physical and verbal assaults weren't justified. In hindsight, I could've told him how I felt months ago and made the conversation much more gradual instead of just dumping it on him. While it is always okay to feel negative emotions, such as anger, in reaction to something, the fact that it turned physical still bothers me to this day as I continue to interact with him.",5,2,5,19,male,White,

This frustrated me and made me feel as though she didn't want to spend time with me since we never see each other any more.

I can see from her side that she wants the best for me and is very protective over me however how I see it is that I am an adult and can make my own decisions.

I am undoubtably a night owl who stays up late and does homework until late at night, leaving not much time to talk to anyone until well past 12:30 am. My boyfriend on the other hand, has been going to bed early, around 10 or 10:30pm and is always annoyed by my sleep schedule. Granted, we do not live together so it is more about our schedules not lining up in other aspects of our lives and me being tired most days than one of us keeping the other awake. His reasoning is that sleep is extremely important (he's not wrong) and necessary for his functioning and difficult workouts the next day. He would rather sacrifice social time than miss sleep, and he feels I should live my life the same way. I however, prioritize work and social time over sleep, and often actually find enjoyment when I am staying up late with friends or on a late night adventure. I also know I will not sleep restfully unless I have gotten done all I have wanted to in the day and find I am almost most productive in the early hours of the morning. Where we find conflict is neither of us conform to the others' expectations and then occasionally get upset with one another when plans cannot happen, or things get missed because of it. I won't go to bed once my boyfriend and I stop hanging out at 9:30pm on the weekends and often go to see other friends afterwards, and it bugs him. He isn't willing to break his sleep schedule for nearly anything, which sometimes bugs me if there is something I still wanted to do or if I want to talk to him later at night. This is a trivial conflict, and exists due to stubbornness rather than lack of communication, but it is not unresolvable. When we are both in the same place overnight, I will conform to his sleep schedule, no matter how hard it is for me to fall asleep or how much I want to stay up because I know how important his sleep is to him, and I'm sure he appreciates it.",4,3,4,19,female,White,

They thought that since their friend had contacted me first and not them that it was a violation of trust and ""going behind her back"". I did not see it that way and thought that her friend was just being thoughtful by sending the invitation to me since I did not know her or anyone attending so that I would feel welcome. The person I was seeing immediately thought about ending their friendship. I was confused and did not think that she should end their long friendship because of an invitation and I explained this to her. She then got very mad at me for not taking her side even if it was the wrong side in this argument. I am not the type of person to agree with someone just because they want me too, especially if I think they are wrong. I held my ground and calmly explained why I did not think that it was a big deal. She got mad at me for ""defending"" her friend and walked away. I walked after her and asked if we could just move on. She yelled at me and left. In the moment I am very sure that she was mad at me and thought I had betrayed her. A little while after she called to apologize for how she treated me. I did not accept her apology because I truly believe that I gave my opinion, listened, and tried to compromise and she just continued to belittle and insult me.

She did not even realize the impact she was making on me, and has agreed to make an effort to be more accepting of me and what I choose to do. The conflict was mostly among myself, I would say. But also not, because she was a source of the conflict, she just did not realize that I was feeling this way.",5,4,4,19,female,White,

1a,1374,pt,"I have had an argument with my parents over my younger brother's schooling and summer plans. He is 15 and goes to high school while living with them. They wanted him to go to a summer cram school so that he can get ahead in some of his studies. He is already a top student in addition to being in extracurricular activities. I know that they really want what is best for his future and to prepare him for college. On the other hand, I do not want them to push him because he is still a teenager and will not have unobligated summers much longer. I would rather he spend his summers now with his friends and doing what he wants to do. I do understand that they are working hard and putting a lot of effort into giving him a good start so they do not want it wasted on something that will not make him happy in the future. Honestly, no one ever knows when things are going to go wrong and no one lives forever so while a contingency plan for the future is a good idea, I think that people should stop worrying about what might happen and start living in what is happening.",6,5,7,19,female,asian,

In the last issue of the semester I was assigning who would design the front page of the paper. Steve (not his real name) was upset that he was assigned to design the front page for some reason. He left our zoom meeting abruptly and didn't respond to any of my messages after. I soon learned that he felt it was unfair that he was being assigned this part of the paper even though it was a part of our normal design rotation. I had to design the page myself and he lost credit for that issue which hurt his grade.,7,1,3,21,male,White,

I felt as if I had been doing most of the work when it came to searching and taking responsibility for the search, while they did little to support. I felt like I was doing all of the heavy lifting. I was the one looking for places to stay at as well as job opportunities for both of us, just to get radio silence in return. In reality, I don't think this was the truth. After speaking with them, I learned that they had in fact been doing work related to the search on their own. They just hadn't been able to tell me because of how busy they were. I think if I were in their shoes, I would probably feel judged or like I was seen as irresponsible.  I would understand that this might be due to a lack of communication.

I used to have a short fuse so I would snap back at her over the smallest things and then we would have an argument. My mom is a very emotional person so this would make her upset and she would go to her room until I eventually stopped being stubborn and went and apologized. I think if I was to ask her about this now she would say something like, ""yeah it sucked during the time we argued a lot, but it ultimately helped us become closer and it helped you mellow out more because you matured from it"".

I felt that she was the one in the wrong and did not want to encourage her behavior towards our other friend. This created some tension between us because we both wanted to support each other, but felt that the other was wrong. I think my friend felt like I was not supportive of her and the things that she was going though. Additionally, I think she felt like I was not being a good friend to her because I did not automatically agree with where she was coming from.

But obviously I was not just going to stop being friends with my guy friends so whenever I hung out with them it had to be a secret otherwise Kelli would freak out and that sucked that I had to keep my friendship with my guy friends a secret. Then one night Kelli was talking crap about Chance and his girlfriend so I texted Nick asking him what I should do because Kelli was saying messed up stuff. She found out that I texted Nick about it and she blew up at me saying I was a horrible friend and that I always choose the guys over my girl friends and it was ridiculous and like I guess I can understand why she would be mad but at the same time I feel like she was just saying all of this because she got caught for talking trash and was finally called out on it. After that I was like this is ridiculous Im done. So Im not friends with her anymore and all of that was just so dumb.,6,3,2,19,female,White,

I offered that we change the design so we can actually have t-shirts. My friend exploded going on and on about how much effort he put into the project for us to scrap the idea. Instead of being realistic and acting for the group, he was being very selfish and simply wanted his design to work, even when he knew he couldn't. Due the time he spent on the project, he couldn't take no for an answer.

My girlfriend's best friend got pretty upset and tried to act like she was above us, and was extremely possessive about my girlfriend, which none of us liked. I sent a brutal text calling her out for being a shit friend and for not caring about my girlfriend as much as she claimed. This ruined almost all the friendships with us and her. I think that in the beginning, they still think that they were in the right and probably think that I am an asshole. However, since then, my girlfriend has ended the friendship between the two because her best friend told her to put her grandma into a retirement home.

It could also be my other roommates lying about it not being their plate/bowl. I have told him many times to stop telling me to put my dishes away, but he does not listen. If I were him, I would take a moment to chill out and not worry about other peoples crap. The funny thing is, he forgets to put his dishes away all the time. I just decide not to nag him about it because I know that he will put it away sooner or later. This is exactly what his thought process should be.

I was not blameless, I was usually pretty rude when I was supposed to be teaching her. It went on for about a month or so and then one day I decided I was tired of constantly being irritated at work by my coworker. So I apologized for not being patient with her and I said that I would do better at explaining and delegating so that I would be less frustrated.

That makes sense to me and I understand that point of view, however, I view cops less as individuals and more as participants in a harmful institution that disproportionately affects people of color and minorities. I tried explaining this to her, but her temper arose since I was not immediately agreeing with her, but instead challenging her opinion. She took things personally and began to make the conversation personal as well, making up ""what if"" scenarios and so on and so forth. It was very tiring to try to comfort her while she was making personal attacks, especially when she started the conversation in the first place. I felt very tired, she felt hurt and angry, so I ended up just saying that we can agree to disagree and made up an excuse to leave the conversation.

I ended up taking my fridge when we got in another fight over an unrelated topic. They probably felt stressed knowing they owed me money they didn't have, and it was probably hard not having enough money for the random things they wanted.

1a,1458,pt,"I will now consider an opposing view to my position. Some people may object to the idea described above based on a misunderstanding of what an improved voter filter would entail. Someone might take this change as a new way to rig the election in favor of someone's political party, which is unacceptable, and a possible risk/danger to the US. They think this because the constant ""fake news"" leaves every citizen to interpret our political climate in their way, usually leading to one person, party, or organization being portrayed as some secret villain. In this view, anything out of the ordinary (real or not) is immediately weaponized to destroy someone's reputation. Take the outrageous idea that Obama faked his citizenship as an example of something random becoming an unreasonable doubt spread to ruin his campaign. This example amounts to the following argument: every person and every action in politics is selfish, and ""unnecessary"" change creates a weak link in our political system that might give someone an unfair advantage.",3,3,3,19,female,Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,

It was really a conflict between one half of the team and the other but it felt like me and one other girl were at the forefront. She and some other teammates had suggested we wear white softball pants for some of our games. This seems fine but in reality, I didn't think it was very logical. White didn't go with our jersey, we had already paid for a grey and a black pair of pants that actually matched our uniform, and nearly half the team did not own white pants. Still, she kept bringing it up and eventually went around us to the coach who said we would be wearing white at the next game. She was the best pitcher in the league and I felt like she thought that it meant that she could get whatever she wanted. I felt like she didn't care at all about what me and half the team were trying to tell her. I think she felt frustrated that we were denying her wants but I also feel like she wasn't even listening to what we were saying. Again, I try to avoid conflict but I did imply that she was being pretty ridiculous considering what a hassle and cost it would be for so many of us just so she could wear white pants for like three games. Looking back, I think this girl and I just weren't on the same page about a lot of things and our personalities did not mesh well together.

I see his dad give him a napkin to wipe off the computer, of course, he is taking his side. This always happens to me, why do people never take my side? Is it really my fault? Well regardless, I am his mom so he can't tell me anything as long as he lives under my roof. So, no it isn't my fault and no I will not apologize for this.

The way he approached me was a bit disrespectful, he believed he deserved stuff from me because he spent time with me, which I don't think should be an aspect of a friendship. Your friends should want to spend time with you because they like you for who you are, not for the amenities you come with. I can understand where he is coming from, though.

He made it clear that he had never missed a day or called in sick and cover for his coworkers every time they could not come in. However, I made it clear to him that I was put in a pretty poor situation on Friday too and the only way I could fix things was if I handed the bulk of the work over to him. I also made it clear that I was his boss and this was not how things that he took issue to were to be handled. That there was a more professional way to go about it.

Abi always talks about how she hates Blake so much and that the only conversations she ever had with him was when they argue in class about politics. I didn't even notice that Blake has a Trump sticker on the back of his iPad, why does Abi get so bothered by it. I think that we should just go without her, it's not like her mom is even going to actually let her go. I think that it would just be less drama if we leave her home and she doesn't come. Abi never likes the guys that I date, she always has something to say about them and how they are making my life harder.

I get that she cleans up immediately after she cooks but thats not how I work best. I will clean them once I don't have other items to worry about. The fact that she's bringing this up again is not going to instantly change my work habits. I am tired of having this conversation over and over again. Maybe we shouldn't all be cooking for ourselves. Maybe one night 1 or 2 people cook and the other 2 or 3 clean. That way the work is split evenly and we don't have to worry about dishes building up. But then she will have a problem with the way we split groceries. I get that she wants it to be fair but if we cant find a time that works with all of our schedules to go grocery shopping we cant find a time.

1a,784,asother,The problem with Hailey is that she is not being considerate of the household we live in and the other people that could be affected by her decisions. By seeing other people outside of this household even with a face mask she would affect the people she cares about like her father who has a very serious health issue that COVID could produce worse symptoms for. Especially since we are leaving for a plane in less than two weeks she should be careful and not see anyone to lower her chances of being affected by COVID. This distance between her friends will only be a couple more months and she has lasted this long without seeing them she can go for a couple more weeks. We have been making sacrifices for our family for 6 years now and especially in this isolated time she should be careful not to worsen this sacrifices we make that could cause serious harm to her loved ones. We were initially going to have this trip planned and Hailey knew that she had to be very careful and especially since many of her friends are in college the exposure statistic is even higher. In California the cases are extremely high and we could possibly go into lockdown so there should be no desire to see them so desperately. Soon she will be reunited with her entire family and have the ability to spend Christmas together while some families can't have that privilege. Even though it may be a while before she sees her friends it will be worth it for their health because when you choose not to see them you lower your chances at putting them more at risk.

1a,856,asother,(Written from my boyfriend's perspective) One of my high school friends was turning 21 over this past Christmas break. To celebrate his birthday we decided to go to his family's cabin for the weekend. The conflict arose from the timing of this trip since it happened during a pandemic. To make this choice possible we chose to get tested prior to going for the weekend. I believed this to be safe enough to proceed with the trip however my girlfriend disagreed. This did not change my decision to go and I went to the birthday trip. This upset my girlfriend and caused us to get into a fight once I got home. We had to talk through the issue in order to resolve it and move past it. We talked about why she didnt think it was a good idea and why I thought it was safe. We were able to resolve it.,5,4,5,20,female,White,

I then sent it to my friend so she could look it over and maybe revise it a bit. After reading it, she told me that I can't turn it in. She was upset that I had 'copied' her essay.

I can understand this, but I feel that she approaches me with too much aggression in these conversations. It makes me feel like a bad person, and she is not empathetic with these feelings. It makes me feel that she will leave me because of my lack of success even though I am putting a lot of effort into this part of my life. She gets so frustrated with me which brings me even more anxiety surrounding these situations. We get into big arguments about these topics and even when I show vulnerable emotions (which is not like me) she completely lacks empathy for me or my emotions even though she usually softens her tone when I show she is upsetting me.

I shared this with my friends and they nodded. Then one of my friends stated that in her opinion she doesn't mind people having same-sex relationships. She claimed that if those people are happy with their lifestyle yet don't force others to join them, she was perfectly fine with gays having their rights. She thought that a relationship is based on love and that love is a very personal thing. She respected people no matter what they fell in love with.

It was partially because of her. She always had an alarm that would wake me up. I would not be able to get the sleep that I wanted and be angry all day.

When she asks me a question it stresses me out all the time and I just ignore her because she does not say things I like or want to hear. When this happens I call her ungrateful and say she is always defending other people. I always bring up the bare minimum moments of things that I did for her years ago or in the past to justify why I do not need to support or give her anything else in the present or future. When she says something I do not want to hear I just assume she is trying to tear me down because she doesn't sugarcoat her words.

I think it is mean for her to act so distant towards me. Once I asked her what was wrong she said she got into an argument with her mom and felt upset.

Yeah and she always takes things so personally, its hard to say anything without her getting upset at something. Whatever lets just tell her how bad could it be.

She is completely incorrect because I am perfect as a person and as a friend. I have never done any wrong in my life and the only reason I acted this way is because of her.

It was stressful as we both were tired and had been walking the entire day already.

However, we left the shop after ten minutes and the bikes were still there, even though I had to pay for them a little bit more than I wanted.

I have a trend of doing this in the past and am open about the fact that I don't know why it happens. I kicked D out of my apartment and A left with him. I got mad at A for leaving and said some nasty things to him as well. In the morning when I sobered up, I apologized at A for my behavior and he said he forgave me. He then spent the rest of the weekend with D and no time at all with me. I was angry because I paid for his flight down here and didn't get to spend much time with him. I asked him to pay me back for his flight because we didn't spend much time together. I know I made a mistake but I don't think that means I should have to fund his vacation, especially considering he said he forgave me for my actions. A said that if I we're truly sorry for what I did than I wouldn't be asking for the money back.",7,2,7,23,male,White,

He didn't know what was happening with me personally but I guess I couldn't be too mad at him for having that reaction since he obviously didn't know what was going on. I just told him that it wasn't a good time and that's when he finally decided to ask if I was ok. I didn't want to say anything to him because I didn't want him involved in my personal life dealing with family drama. He insisted that he would be there for me if I needed to talk another time.

Person A realized that they don’t care if there is a chore chart or not but rather they want both people to be considerate of one another so one person isn’t putting in more work than the other. They both agree that they are cleaning the same amount but person A was paying more attention to the chore chart rather than what was being cleaned and Person B didn’t pay attention to the chore chart at all and didn’t take into account that person A was going off of that. Now they both make an effort to notice what the other is cleaning so that they can clean it next time and also to acknowledging the work the other person is putting in to keep the apartment clean.,6,6,6,20,female,"Some other ethnicity or origin, please specify:",mixed race

When Kevin sat down with the someone in the registrar's office to figure out the problem the person helped little. James, the person Kevin met with in the office, first started by providing Kevin the wrong information. He told Kevin the school his major was in would just override the rule and let him register for the class. When Kevin left the meeting and went to his respective school, he was informed that that has never been allowed someone at the registrar's office just needed to fix it for him. When Kevin went back and met with James for a second time, James showed very little remorse. He said that at this point Kevin would just have to wait until someone else in the office got around to switching it for him. Kevin then proceeded to ask James if he had the ability to change it right now, and if it would take very long, to which James said he could but he had to much other stuff to do.

B and R are roommates and best friends, they get along so well because they are so similar. They are both so sweet and genuine, they both love to travel and are both introverts. They are so close that they even share a bed, but with sharing a room there is limited alone time, something they both need as introverts. They tend to live in this cycle of having a really good and fun friendship to hardly talking and giving one another attitude. They are both so selfless that they never want to explain how they are personally feeling, thus the cycle continues. 

From the outside, the relationship can seem toxic for B and R. However, they are each other's person, the one who understands everything and affirms their feelings. I think they both need to learn to be more selfish in a way though. Watching them go through the cycle of having a good and bad friendship is confusing and makes me sad to see.

There was conflict that happened between two players, It seemed as if the conflict originated because one player fouled the other on a really promising opportunity he had to make a goal. I couldn't really make out what they were saying with the whistles and crown yelling in response to the players pushing each other in anger. Earlier in the game there was obvious tension between the two as they would become more ""physical"" when they were met up on the soccer field. It never makes sense to me why athletes and players get mad at each other for defending their goal. They both have they same job play the game, defend your goal, and score goals. It is almost frustrating seeing players conflict with one another for just doing their job. This conflict isn't like a rare occurrence either if you spend just some decent amount of time watching a 18 years or older soccer match, they get in arguments all the time. it just ruins the sport and game for players, coaches, fans, and referees especially.",3,3,4,19,male,"hispanic, latinx, or spanish origin",

Likewise, he (referring to me) believed that he could not see a way that the relationship could continue happily and healthily, and he therefore did not think it was a good idea to remain together.

1a,1212,as3party,"I believe that looking at a conflict as a third-party observer can quickly escalate. Watching two people begin to get closer, with emotions tensing up leads to a third-party observer waiting for a moment to possibly intervene. If someone began to shove the other person, there's a sense of action that needs to take place, but often I would want to hold back just because it is really not my business. I think that as soon as there are real punches or attacks tat begin, someone should intervene before a major disaster occurs. Often, there is that bystander shock if a fight goes down and that can be a barrier to helping, but a situation that has the potential to escalate very quickly is something that should be at least loosely monitored. Personally, unless someone is about to get hurt I just ignore conflicts in like a parking lot because it is really not my business or belief that I should intervene into something that I have nothing to do with.",6,3,1,21,male,"hispanic, latinx, or spanish origin",

As each day goes by, she does not speak up about wanting to be paid back and thought it was common sense. While the other roomate completely forgets and moves on with her day. Being on the outside of this situation was kinda embarrassing and frustrating to listen to. As they continued to search for the price of food and worrying about never being paid back, they go behind one another backs to their fiends, talking about how immature and annoyed they are with one another. This goes on for days, and finally the dues are paid for, but they don't know that they said some things behind each others backs - nor apologize. Brushing it off their shoulders, the roommates agree to disagree that they will never buy anything for anyone unless they pay back before, during or immediately after something was purchased. Although this was a situation they could have handled much faster and simpler, money is something that can cause arguments very easily, without even noticing it.

The next day, the couple left in the middle of the night on a greyhound, leaving a note (written by the roommate that left the room abruptly) for one of the roommates.

The father immigrated to the states when he was 25 and had been struggling financially for almost half a decade since he had moved. The father felt his struggles were all worth it as long as he had a son that would follow in his footsteps and become everything he had ever hoped for. When the boy was in 10th grade, he had gone through a traumatic social experience at school. His friends had bullied him and he was left friendless and alone for the better part of 6 months. In those 6 months, his grades had suffered and his college prospects seemed to have diminshed from what they could have been. The son had suffered emotionally and the father felt like his financial suffering wasn't worth it anymore. The father ignored his son's presence and had made the son feel like he wasn't accepted not only at school but at home as well. Years later, the son is doing better academically and emotionally and the father believes it is all due to his efforts. He does not acknowledge the fact that his son had to climb over many obstacles and that his son had been tortured by everyone around him. He simply believes that it was because of his berating, insulting, and manipulation that his son had decided enough was enough and became more academically invested. This was one of the more larger conflicts between father and son that had occurred within the last 6 months. The son feels like no matter what he achieves and no matter what he is capable of that his father will never acknowledge the fact that it is due to his son's effort that he achieved these things. The son knows what his father put him through when he was suffering and he sees that there is a complete shift in his father's attitude once he began to succeed once more.

One party states that getting a vaccine is a personal choice, even if someone has no health complications that would inhibit them from getting a vaccine.

The first party says that because of their mistrust in the validity of the vaccine, they can understand why some people wouldn't want to have it in their body. The other party says that because the vaccine was approved for emergency use by the FDA, it is safe to take. The conflict is that the first party believes that there is no moral obligation for anyone to take a vaccine while the second party believes that there is. The second party states that negligence to create the safest possible environment for people at risk would implicate that person if someone were to be hurt as a consequence of their choice to not get the vaccine. The first party argues that if someone is at risk, it would be only their fault if they got sick. The first party continues to explain that there are far too many reasons to not take the vaccine and only one reason to get it: keeping other people safe.

The disagreement in our course of action was either to stay at this pizza place and order pizza or go to a different place, but the next cheapest place was a couple miles of driving away. I convinced my other friends to stay, but the friend I had conflict with decided he wouldn't order the pizza. He instead got the chicken parmesan, which was in fact more money, but he didn't see issue with it.

He was really talented in a lot of areas, such as sports, academics, and social life, and so I wanted to be like him and worked hard to meet his level of talent. However, this desire turned more into jealousy, which caused me to break off our friendship multiple times over the sheer jealousy but also anxiety of not feeling good enough. There was one particularly bad instance last year where I blew up at him when he was vulnerable, which was a rare occurrence as he was very private. Instead of helping him through the problem like I usually do with people, I blew up at him and ended the friendship again. Things never really completely healed after that, and we went around six months not talking to each other and avoiding each other at all costs. It was extremely painful, so eventually I reached out apologizing profusely for everything that happened. His response, however, was that he didn't want to be friends, which I understood and accepted to the best of my ability. A month later, after I had moved on, he messaged me again asking if I wanted to be friends once more, which was extremely frustrating because I had just moved on as I had said, but eventually I caved and began talking with him again. That was in May, and to this day, we have become even better friends than before.",3,5,6,18,male,,

I explained that I think the best way to take out the trash would be Thursday night.

My sister said that she thought the best time and day to take out the trash was right on Friday morning when we were leaving for school. I thought this was not logical because what if the trash truck comes earlier than expected or what if we have to rush out of the house for school.

My mom does not like this behavior at all, and tells this to my stepdad as that is his daughter's doing. He gets extremely mad whenever my mother mentions this, and just brushes it off. My stepsister and her boyfriend sleep in the room next to mine and I smell marijuana smoke almost every day. As someone whose lungs are weak, I cannot take it sometimes and want to do something about it. I will eventually tell her to stop, but as a shy person I am not sure on what to do on the situation. She sneaks around like a rat at night and eats cereal with her boyfriend at like 3AM, which disgusts me.",7,1,2,19,female,,

That there are other ways we should be dealing with mental disorders or stress. He then further explained in medication not being needed alongside therapy. I disagreed and my opinion was that therapy is very helpful and so are meds if you need them. See is a firm believer that sports, outside activities, and ignoring the problem with solve the issues. This then further shows lack of emotional intelligence and understanding.",6,2,6,19,female,,

Keep in mind this person is currently in South Korea. From my perspective I understand their feeling of being too busy, but I can also contradict that for the reason being that, it is not hard to have a less than 5 minute phone call. We both agreed that they would call as soon as they have time and have the desire to. However, we both knew promises were broken and messaging is the best way to communicate.",2,6,6,18,female,,

He listened to my request of getting me a specific type of skateboard instead of some knock off from the thrift store plus some other stuff I would never use because he's to be blunt a cheapskate but for the first time he got me something of value. I expressed my happiness about this to my other family members when i got back to my aunts house. So my aunt decided to go behind my back to text my father and tell him that I loved the gift. Which in no way was her place in this situation. Since, I had already texted him and told him that I liked it myself. How i feel is that it was non of her buisness. However, my aunt technically has known my father for a very long time and she herself had s very bad relationship with her father. I understand why she thought she needed to get involved.

I'm sure he believes that he's teaching me to be self-reliant but he's actually made it nearly impossible for me. I'm already in debt because of student loans and am facing financial crisis. Because of this, I've kicked myself into high gear and created an ambitious degree plan to double major and graduate a year early. At first he thought it was great that I was trying to minimize my debt by graduating early. I'm really excited about this degree plan, but now any time it's mentioned he berates me. He doesn't believe it obtainable for me and he mocks that I won't be able to pay and therefore be able to continue my college education. I'm sure that he wants me to succeed but his words and actions make me feel like he actually wants me to fail. I think he enjoys this conflict because he's allowed to berate me.",7,1,5,19,female,,

I was describing my feelings about the stay at home order and personal safety. My father and his girlfriend were both on the opposite viewpoint as me. I think they both thought they were accepting the risks of getting coronavirus and their feelings of being frustrated their lives were being put on hold. They also had strong feelings about our Governor's actions amidst the pandemic. That may have influenced the severity of their opinions against his actions and how they described it to me. Overall, we just argued and disagreed about the issue as I felt like they weren't taking it seriously and weren't listening to me.",6,3,5,18,female,,

However, after I was done, I asked my boyfriend if he would want to spend some more time together at his house. I wanted to see him even though it was a long drive. Unfortunately, my lazy boyfriend did not want to drive and pick me up. We sort of started to argue about it because I wanted to see him but he didn't want to drive. I couldn't drive yet and so I had no option but to let him win. It was sort of hurtful, I wanted him to show the love to be willing to see me again.",5,3,7,19,male,,

I had been making food when I noticed that my partner had gone and bought something at the store and so I ask them why they had done so (the item they got was something we already had in the house). It turned into a fight because my partner felt attacked by the way I approached them about the situation, and was incredibly aggressive in response due to that. Unfortunately, their response was unhelpful in making me understand the problem they had with me and only made me more mad about the situation. It ended up spiraling out of control and the fight quickly became us just hurting each other's feelings for a while. The only whole time I imagine my partner was distressed about how hectic the situation was and how it only seemed to be getting out of control.

I asked my mom to come pick me up and my dad was furious with me and continued to insult my mother. I am sure that this was because of his frustration with a very difficult situation. While he could have handled it a lot better, I can understand where the anger came from. Anyway, my dad showed up at my mom's house and told me to go back with him which I did.

Other issues were brought up throughout the course of the argument. She felt like I was not taking enough responsibility in maturing into adulthood while I felt dismissed and misunderstood not only in life but in the house.

However, coach still said to let her know about these situations when they happen not after. They also did not want to call the girls parents which i believed to be incredibly wrong because any parent would want to know if their kid was going to the hospital.

She apologized and I said it was fine, but we would need to figure out how much she owes me. Much later, I was reached out and asked for $120 for the book since it was in a great condition. She searched the book online and found that Craigslist sold a used book for $40 so she said she would give me that much. This was way less than my asking price and the price of the book I bought so I rejected. I would not have resold the book for $40 so I was not going to settle for a quarter of my original buying price. She said I could take the $40 or leave with nothing.

The messiness of the house and my rummaging through sentimental items caused my mother great anguish and stress. She was afraid I would throw out important things and mad that I disordered previously cluttery-but-ordered rooms. She expressed distress and worry that I would throw out something important to her.

She started shouting at me that she was bisexual and that it was racist of me to say that's why I wouldn't go. She said I was too privileged to understand why I should go. She talked about a black teacher of ours who made an announcement at assembly about his trips to Tanzania. He had that he never felt that much respect in his life. What she said about this was """"didn't you listen to what Marshall said? He didn't go there to feel safe and comfortable. He went to feel challenged."""" I mostly didn't respond to her because it was my experience that she was not a very reasonable listener in arguments so I let her come to some conclusion and then I left. She never let it go and messaged me two years later out of the blue in a scathing essay about how horrible I am as a person. I think her feelings were influenced by the fact that she's black and she has experienced racism and prejudice constantly in her life. I believe that her feelings were that I didn't wanna go because it would be out of my comfort zone as a white person and that the reason I gave her wasn't valid.

Admittedly I was meeting him for only the second time and already had a bad impression of him, so I was upset more easily than I may have been if it was someone else doing it. I do think it's a very annoying thing to do regardless though. I think he has mostly forgotten about it, but my mother and I still remember it. I guess he probably felt a little shocked by how upset I became because in his mind he did nothing wrong and was just having fun.

The entire conflict is such a complex thing to explain with in-depth reasoning and the difference in how we grew up and the backgrounds we came from prior to college. So although the surface conflict occurred on my birthday, there were months of little things that had been overlooked and feelings that were not expressed. It was a combination of my bad experiences with holiday events growing up and my irritation with the lack of responsibility for safety and consideration of the reality of the plan conflicting with any other plans that caused me to come across as ungrateful and unappreciative of the thought she put in to the day and her best effort to make me happy.

I disagreed, believing that he should be more aggressive with his policies and attack the Republican Party more, but he doesn't. I think that he shouldn't be focusing on convincing Trump supporters to switch over, but to rather encourage his own base that he will be a good president. From my Mom's perspective, I think she thinks that because I'm young I don't know enough about politics to know what is the appropriate course of action. I also don't think she gives enough attention to this conflict anyways. I on the other hand really want her to see that the politics she is taking a part in is actually hurting the left-wing movement more than it's helping. We need to be more aggressive with our progressive values, and that's how we gain more support. She also wants us to focus on unifying the country, which I don't think is possible.",6,3,5,18,male,,

I panicked and really unloaded everything that I was feeling, so they had no other option but to take me to a mental hospital so that I would be safe. It was very traumatizing and I cursed my parents the entire way, because I felt like they were abducting me and making do something I didn't want to do because I felt fine and okay. However, in hindsight, they were just worried about me and wanted me to get the best care possible. Anyways, I eventually left and went home, where we had a huge argument over the situation: essentially my parents were super frightened and out of their depth and had no idea what to do, and I was extremely scared of going back to the hospital. A lot of insults were traded, all of which I regret and I'm sure they did too. In the end, I slept in my own bed that night and ended up getting the help that I needed.",1,6,5,18,male,,

She felt that I was not being a good friend because I wasn't spending enough quality time with her. I felt she was not being a good friend because she wasn't understanding that I was constantly busy and had a lot on my plate. We had a conversation about it, but it didn't really go anywhere. She was sad I didn't make time to spend with her which I tried to understand. What she didn't understand was that I had a lot going on with my life that I couldn't talk to her about it. We came to the conclusion in the end that I would try to spend more time with her and she would try to understand my schedule.

One of my roommates, Gina, refused to get tested. She said she believed that it was unnecessary and unfair because she did not have any symptoms.

From his perspective, he deserved to use his money the way he wanted to, and regardless of previous mistakes he had made financially prior to this conversation he believed that he deserved another shot at being the money manager.

I even helped her move into her new apartment in downtown Portland when I came home from school (out of state). Anna, two other friends, and I would often hang out together--however, occasionally we would hang out without Anna, which we thought to be an okay thing to do. This would make Anna upset, but in our minds we didn't feel the need to invite Anna every-time. Anna is extremely social and had a lot of friends that she would hang out with without us. I understand how Anna might've felt bummed that we were hanging out without her, or how she might've felt like we were consciously excluding her.

I made plans with Anna (before leaving for school for another 4 months), in which I had to bus all the way downtown and then walk to her apartment. We hung out, only for her to tell me 20 minutes later that she made plans with someone else and has to leave.

I just wish that she would have told me and not kept it a secret from me specifically. It seemed like everyone except for me knew. If she would have told me, I wouldn't have been so upset. I just hate being kept in the dark about these things. I don't think you're supposed to do those types of things to your friends, but I guess she thought otherwise. She said it was her life and she can do whatever she likes. I guess she's right about that, but you have to take into account if those actions will end up hurting other people or not and if its worth it. We didn't see eye-to-eye on that and I don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't take their friends feelings into account.

Our band was cancelled and we got kicked off of 15 planned shows, and had to cancel our tour. Obviously theres a lot more details than that, but thats basically what happened. We all got bullied and received death threats and were publicly shamed for supporting our friend, who we knew was innocent of what he was accused of.

1b,93,pt,"Me and my boyfriend love to play Dungeons and Dragons. He has been playing for many years and has a lot of experience with the game. I however only just recently started playing. Basically what we disagreed on was me trying to make my character for a campaign. I didn't know what to do or where to find the information to actually make the character and have all the things I needed done. So I asked my boyfriend for help. What annoyed him was that I kept asking for help. Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue, but we were under a time constraint and he needed to still make his character. What he felt was that I wasn't doing anything and that he was doing everything. I agree that I was asking a lot of him and he was stressed. I just wanted help because I've never really done this kind of thing before. I think he felt used and stressed about the situation. It was hard for either of us to see from the others perspective at the time.",4,5,5,18,female,,

However, my mother and I do not want to fly there and put us at risk, so we decided on driving. However, we are driving from Los Angeles to Eugene, which is a long trip. I think it is easiest to leave early in the morning and get to Eugene in a day. That way we can pack up my stuff once we get there, put some of it in storage the following day and then return home. However, my mother thinks we should split up the driving so it is two days to get there and two days to get back. This would involve us staying in several hotels and increase our risk for coronavirus. However, this would also make the drive easier and we could take a scenic route along the coast since we would have more time.",6,5,5,18,female,,

She got her money and paid me back but not the full amount.

1b,136,pt,"Last year we had one full week of having so much snow that schools were canceled and some people couldn't even make it to work. The driving conditions were quite scary. My mom was working nightshifts and my dad was still having tiring days at work in this weather. Roughly at 10 pm one night during this week, my dad was sleeping. I heard our home phone ring and then his phone, and then my phone went off. It was my grandpa calling. He said that my grandma had lost her memory of most of the events pertaining to that entire month. I was on speaker with the two of them and she couldn't remember our family friend passing away in the 3 weeks prior or remember her tooth surgery she had a month ago. She couldn't even remember that it was snowing terribly. This was very scary because my grandmother had never had issues like this before, and was normally sharp as can be. She proceeded to forget in a matter of seconds anything new we told her either, every time she learned of our friend's passing she would begin crying again and again. My grandpa didn't know what to do so I know we had to get over to their house as soon as possible. I woke up my dad to tell him, but I'm pretty sure he just assumed I was over reacting. I told him it was urgent and from having such an exhausting week at work I think he lastly wanted to head over there when it was getting so late. He then called my grandpa to see for himself, having to have the same conversation with he two of them that I just had on the phone. I told him that my grandpa needed to call the ambulance, but him being tired and probably still thinking I was an over reacting kid who didn't know much, said that it should be fine if we went over there, then we could take her to the hospital ourselves if we thought we needed too. He got off the phone with my grandpa and wound up calling another friend of his for advice, taking another 15+ minutes to be on the phone and get dressed again. In this time I was able to convince my grandpa to call an ambulance, which turns out what would have been what saved her had she had a stroke, and initially that is what the first-responders thought had happened. I wound up staying at the hospital by my grandma's side as she went through different scans, being the one to calm her down. I told both my grandpa and dad to not bring up our friend's passing away either while she couldn't remember. Her memory came back within maybe 5 hours of her being at the hospital, the loss being due to something called transient global amnesia. I know my father was grateful for me afterwards, he told me he was impressed with how I handled everything. I think he was scared about how life would change so much had she actually suffered memory loss or a stroke. I think him being in denial was his way of helping him assume that I was over reacting.",7,2,7,19,female,,

My other two roommates just said he's learning so they would always help and do his dishes for him. I said this was just enabling and he needed to learn to grow up.

1b,179,pt,My drama teacher was also the director of the spring musical and put all the difficult tasks on herself. She was stressed and irritated because of the amount of work she had already done for the play and the amount of work she still had left to do. It was hard enough going through a divorce but the added stress of dealing with inconsiderate teenagers put a strain on her. She had recycled a dress from the costume rack for my character and then had another student decorate it. When she asked me what I thought I was horrified. She had worked hard to create a costume she thought presented the fairy queen and I didn't have the heart to tell her I hated it. It didn't fit my image of the character. I asked if we could take off some of the new additions and she told me that it was perfect and beautiful and I should appreciate it. She was probably disappointed with my reaction because she had worked hard with another student on the costume and I had not even given a thanks. I knew I had angered her and that brought tears to my eyes. Her anger wasn't directed at me but I felt it all the same. In the end I decided to look at the dress in a different light instead of trying to change it.,2,5,7,19,female,,

This included calling my insurance, calling the clinic I was going to, calling my aunt who is a physician, etc. I'm a very very private person- I don't like people in my business. I told her """"thank you, but don't do that"""" I had already called the clinic to see if they accepted my insurance (which they did) and I didn't want my extended family to get involved.

My mom was also worried that if I grabbed that rock, it would instead pull me under and I might drown. Because of that, I didn't grab onto the rock and we continued down the rapids. However, another situation came up, as we were still floating down, me and my mom got separated before we were, she told me to just keep floating down and not to grab onto anything. I then had to decide whether or not to listen to her advice. I decide to because my mom was a lot smarter than me, which was seen before when she told me to not grab onto the rock.

So the situation started with someone venting about a black trans man who died from police brutality in the riots that have been happening and how the media misgendered him. This person also said â€œI fucking hate cis peopleâ€. This person was the person I disagree the most with how they handled the situation for simplicity's sake i'll call them A. the person I sided more with will be called B. so B was offended by this because theyâ€™re cisgender. And it escalated from there. A said they didnt care and that when Bâ€™s kind (cis people) stop murdering, deadnaming and misgendering trans people then theyll talk. As someone who is also trans I understand some of Aâ€™s feelings. I have had a lot of bad experiences with cis people and in the context of opression its totally valid to say that you hate cis people, because hate crimes against trans people do exist and trans people die because of it. I also know why Aâ€™ was weary about B saying that they make an effort to not deadname, misgender or murder anyone. Performative allyship is a thing. A lot of time people say there an ally but never do anything to stand up for trans people and continue to deadname and misgender them without even trying to make an effort to not do that. My parents were like that too and told me to not correct them when they get my pronouns wrong because it sounded rude to them (even though I was trying to ask as politely as I could) and that if I did that they would be less willing to be an ally. A started getting personal and directly insulting B though which I can't agree with because B genuinely did seem like they were actually making an effort to learn and weren't just being a fake ally like my parents were. But just because they make an effort doesnt mean theres still more to learn about being an ally.

Faith, Natalie and I really had no ill intentions and didn't even think about the other girls when signing up for this camp. We just thought it would be fun for the three of us to go and we were the most close out of the team. I had never hung out with Francine before without the rest of the team and didn't consider her a close friend, so I didn't put her feelings into consideration when I was making the plan with Faith and Natalie to go to this camp. We should've told the whole team about it so they would have the chance to go with us, but instead we kept it to ourselves.

She felt like I wasn't respecting her views even though the post said nothing negative about any specific party. She felt like I had betrayed her because I didn't have the exact same political stance as her, even though we ended up both voting for the same president. I think she saw me as a white middle-class woman who wouldn't listen to her views when in reality, I understand the privileges I had and know that other people come from different backgrounds. It was important to her to make sure she let me know that she wasn't happy with me. In the end, I don't regret anything I said and told her I felt like she was overreacting to a crappy meme that wasn't meant to hurt anyone.",6,4,4,19,female,,

I have brought it up multiple times and he always tries to assure me that the excuses for me not being there are valid, but I don't always feel like they are. We've had the same argument about this multiple times now, and it really feels like he doesn't want me around his friends. He has started to get more and more annoyed each time I bring it up so now I feel discouraged to even talk about it, because it doesn't feel like he completely cares or understands that it makes me feel sad and excluded.",6,3,7,18,male,,

One of my friends wanted to smoke a cigarette and i hate the smell. I audibly sighed and they said whatever and continued to smoke with the window down. Only, I was behind them so the window was just blowing cold air in my face on the highway and smoke back into the car. I think the other person did not care what I thought and thought that I was being the annoying and difficult one by having an opinion on the matter. Let alone, saying or audibly exhibiting my frustration. I think they got mad that i was mad. We were also hungry and stopped at Mcdonald's. My friend ordered a cheeseburger and asked if any tomatoes came on it and if so to have them removed. I laughed and said there are not tomatoes on a cheeseburger at mcdonalds and he replied, """"sorry i am not a fat ass that eats fast food everyday and knows the menu of the top of my head.""""

She understandably wants to be able to see a small group of friends, however, those friends also have other friends they see. Therefore, roommate A and I asked her to refrain from seeing those friends especially while the pandemic is so bad.

There are a few specific instances where they havenâ€™t been respectful, but itâ€™s kind of just a constant ongoing thing. It personally made me very upset for a few reasons. One, because they are being disrespectful to someone I love very much, and 2, he doesn't ever do anything about it. He never really stands up for himself. I know it hurts him when his friends do this and it also hurts him when I give him shit about it, but it deeply bothers me that he doesnâ€™t do anything about it. There was one time when all of his friends were going up to Oregon to visit their friend who lived up there and no one told my boyfriend. They actually tried very hard to keep it a secret from him. After weeks and weeks of trying to convince him to stand up for himself and countless arguments, he finally talked to his friends about it. He has no backbone and it is the most frustrating thing. I know it makes him feel horrible that his friends do this and that his girlfriend gives him such a hard time, but I donâ€™t understand how someone could be so dismissive towards issues he's having with people he considers his best friends. Nothing bothers me more than someone who canâ€™t stand up for themselves.",6,2,6,18,female,,

As it was so late, I thought that the best decision was to stay at a hotel room instead of driving home in the dark. On the other hand, my other friend disagreed. She didn't want to have to pay for a hotel room, so she wanted to drive home. I immediately thought she was crazy considering that she wasn't going to be the one driving home anyways.

I argued that they were, I was the president of 2 clubs and a member of 2 more, which was per her request to get involved in school to look good on applications and resumes, and the fact I wasn't home often wasn't in defiance but rather in just pure necessity. I think she felt as if I was simply being lazy and not cleaning up after myself, and that I was defying her requests to clean my room. She works from home, and even though I keep my door closed, she's a neat freak and just knowing of the mess behind my door drove her crazy, and I just wasn't at the house enough to even notice or fix my mess.

Eventually we were both aware of my feelings for her and were very comfortable with each other. Comfortable enough to talk about sex and our feelings. I might have been too comfortable, because I basically Asked her to have sex with me almost everyday. It was not okay, and I pretty much sexually harassed her. Eventually, I got her to come back to my house with me to hang out after school, and I asked her If I could kiss her, she hesitated and then I said please. She told me 'okay, because you said pease'. We started making out, I asked her If I could take her shirt of and she said it was okay and took it off. Thats as far as things went, we did not ever have sex. A few weeks later I finally lost my virginity to this other girl I was really fond of and Romy wanted me to tell her about it. When I did, she kinda seemed jealous. I'd have to mention that at the timeI was making music everyday, so that day I wrote a song where the chorus goes """" How You gone steady say no, then get jealous of my hoes, just because my flow is gold she don't wanna see me go"""" and Romy Lost it.

Yet, he didn't listen to our mature conversation. We got in an argument over it.

I chose the University of Oregon because it had such a good business school that was closely connected to companies I have a lot of interest in working for. This made the decision for me worth it because the major I have should allow me to make very good money out of college so getting a foot in the door while im at school will help me offset the extra costs of college.

At first the people of the apartment blamed us for the extensive damage but they had let the water flow for too long and they were the main reason there was a flood in the first place. There was black soot being gathered in the pipes and they had never checked it which was the main cause of the flood according to the firefighters.,2,6,4,19,male,,

Because I went to sleep later I would be on my phone later. Sometimes my best friend from home would also facetime me late at night. Other times, my sister or cousin would call me from home to talk. When this would happen I could see that she was annoyed with me. I would usually step outside into the hallway to continue my phone call. She eventually started asking me to put in my headphones.

My other friend was curious as me about their religion and beliefs we started asking questions. They also returned questions since we both had grown up in such different ways. It first was pretty basic like have you ever considered other trains of thought which tended to be a negative. But the main conflict actually came with an argument about abortion based on religious beliefs. My main friend I argued with was saying that I was """"pro-abortion"""" which I kept correcting to a more pro the right to choose. I basically was arguing that even though he has his own views it seemed unfair to me that he would try to put on his views to others. This was not taken well or with much listening.",2,6,7,19,male,,

During winter break I was having some problems with my family and I tried to talk to her about it. She was very dismissive of my anxiety about going home for winter break. Since we are from the same place and she knew I had problems being home for that month I assumed we would hang out during the break. She ignored me for most of the month. I decided to move back to the dorms about a week and a half left in the break, where I was alone for quite a while. A few days after she got back I started getting sick but still decided to go to work anyway, it happened to be a terrible snow day that day so I had to walk 10 blocks in the snow to work and back. Before I left for work that day I asked her to go grab us some more toilet paper from the store because we were out (the closest store was across the street). When I got back she said that she just didn't feel like it and that it was too cold for her to get out of bed that day. Although the fight seemed silly, it was so much more than just the toilet paper. That just seemed to be the breaking point for me.",2,6,5,22,female,,

Any time I mention it, it makes him upset because he is a good driver. I believe he is a good driver, but getting to close to a car really scared me. He also likes to drive weird just to be funny or to scare me which makes it worse. I admit that Iâ€™m not the best passenger though.

When we asked her why she said it would prevent her dad from working. My friends and I disagreed with her that it was the responsible thing to get tested so her father would not spread the virus if she did have it and they were in close contact. She refused to get tested and decided to quarantine in her room. It felt really intense because each side of the argument was firm on their decision. To us it seemed as though there was only right way to deal with the situation and it was to get tested, but she did not feel the same way.

They both gave me the impression we were no longer hanging out and said they were both busy with prior responsibilities. I then saw on social media that they were hanging out and so I called them out and said if they wanted to hang out without me they should have just told me straight up instead of lying to me.

This frustrates me because I do not feel like they need to know every detail of my life, especially on days when I will not be seeing them. On the other side of things, this also frustrates them because they do not know what I am up to and this makes them anxious, since they like to be in control. I feel that I should be given more space; however, I also see my friend's point of view, as I am constantly busy and they would like me to be as productive as possible so when we spend time together I am not stressing over needing to complete homework or tired because of lack of sleep. The most challenging part of this conflict is that they speak up on what bothers them about me and they tell me what I need to work on every day, where I only bring up what bothers me once and then I learn to deal with it.

Not having her tell me anything made me fear something was going on with her because she would put on a smile and try to sweep the issue under the rug when she was around adults. When I met her boyfriend for the first time, I noticed that my daughter seem to have liked him more than he liked her. Knowing that experience of hearing stories from other and seeing people go through heartbreak, those that chase the other person more would experience the heartbreak worse and puts an imbalance in their schedule. Fearing that, I tried to address the issue to my daughter starting with asking hypothetical questions to make her rethink about her relationship with him because I was trying to protect her. She started to defend her boyfriend of saying that it wouldn't happen and would move on if it occurs. I acknowledged that it was the start of the relationship but a lot of factors can occur such as cheating on the significant other, lying about their whereabouts, and even falling in love. She kept rebelling and provide supportive statements upon those accusations. I felt bad but I had to do what was right to make sure she found a good that would not only treat her right but treat her family as well. I dropped the bomb by telling her that my husband didn't like for the same reason. Doing that lead to point of her yelling at me and ended up in tears.",5,5,3,20,female,,

Later, from previous experiences, I wanted to tell the tutor a form of teaching that might benefit the tutee. I decided to go back and tell the tutor my perspective. The tutor responded angrily and kept on interrupting me from telling them my opinion. Both the tutor and tutee seemed frustrated. When the tutor calmed down, they let me explain their perspective.

While there is stuff she does do, when it comes to getting her siblings together to help out, she lets me down pretty often. One of her major concerns is that I put more responsibility on her than my second oldest, who does just about nothing around the house. While I do see this, it is exhausting trying to get her to help, so I rely on the oldest. Is it fair? No. Do I do it anyways? Yes. Either way, between their father being a literal headache at all hours of the day and my children offering no extra assistance, I find myself taking out my anger on the oldest.

A couple of my friends agreed with me while others didn't want to walk. They didn't want to walk because it was too hot outside which I understand but also it was nice outside and I didn't want to drive down that road. They offered to pay for gas which they never do so I took them up on that offer. We still wanted to walk so we did but at that time everyone was in a bad mood because they were too hot. Once we got to our destination it was nice and we were able to go farther than anticipated if we drove. When we got back to the car our friends said they would split the gas which is not what we talked about before because I am always the one paying for gas even though we always take my car.

If it wasn't for me, he would never have met her in the first place and it is just unfair how us as friends can just be put to the side and his excuse for not hanging out with us most of the time is that he is with his family.

Our plan was to fly down and fly the 2 dogs back up. I hadn't put much thought into it but I prefer to fly over drive since the flight is 2 hours and the drive is about 15 hours. My wife suggested driving was the better option, as the flights were at peak prices since it was a holiday weekend.

It wasn't that running up the hill was bad but the effect of it would cause them to get their uniforms dirty just before competition. Why would anyone listen to Person A when she is an underclassman? So I told her that she should stop no one is gonna listen to her because she is younger. She didn't respond to my comment but she did stop shouting at the others.

I think weed is much safer than any other drugs I could be using, and just because I'm under 21 and don't have an official doctors' note shouldn't mean that I can't reap the benefits of it. My mom buys me the cartriges, my roomate and most of my friends use marijuana, and my moms close friend's husband uses it with a medical card.

1b,6,asother,I'm an RA for the lab! I had a conflict with my roommate about flipping the dirty or clean sign on the dishwasher to indicate if the dishwasher was clean or dirty. His perspective would be-- I don't feel like we need a sign because the dishwasher has a light that turns on when the dishes are clean. I feel like this should be enough of an indicator to tell if the dishwasher is dirty or clean. I feel like you should just look at the light instead of having to use a pointless sign. This process could be very streamline and does not need the extra step of the sign. Just use the light and know that when it is off the dishwasher is dirty and when it is on its clean. Then we don't have to waste the extra time of flipping the sign. I feel like it is pointless and a waste of my time.,5,3,5,,,,

1b,244,asother,I would have felt guilty for almost hitting my friend and or dog with my scooter.  I would have said it was my mistake for swinging around a heavy piece of metal around someone and their dog.  I would have been upset I was punched when I did not actually hurt anything.  My feelings were hurt when I was screamed at and punched.  It was a mistake to swing around a scooter but that was a harsh reaction. My friend should trust me enough to where she knows that I am not intentionally going to hurt anything.  My friend should have known I immediately felt bad.  I scootered off because I could not handle being yelled at and feeling bad.  We both needed time to cool down before we can discuss what happened.,3,6,7,19,female,,

She offered to take them for free because she said it was no big issue and offered to also take some extras of any ideas I had. About 2 weeks later we go out and take photos for 8 hours. We are both exhausted but end the day with around 1,000 photos shot. She later narrows this done to 800, removing any bad or scrap images. At this point, she gave me all the images and offered to edit a few of what I wanted to post and use. I told her it was okay because I enjoyed to edit them on my phone! Months later I end up thinking a really good idea my old photographer pitched related to photo ideas from months ago. I decide to go to a different photographer this time and give her my friends original work and ideas to replicate. My friends sees once I post them to Instagram and becomes incredibly hurt that I gave away her ideas. I tell her it isnâ€™t a big deal because there are always new ideas but she stressed the fact that her content was first and that it was already copyrighted. This leads to a larger argument in which both disagree about who has right to photo.",5,4,7,20,female,,

When we finally talked, she told me she might be suffering from social anxiety and that she needs coping mechanisms for overthinking. I asked how long this had been going on for, maybe it could be more of an issue because of the stress of the pandemic? I helped her set up an appointment with her doctor who could then give her a referral to see a therapist. However, the doctor told her to try meditation and breathing exercises. I think that's a viable option, I do mediation every once and a while. I told my daughter to do as the doctor said, but she doubts it'll work. Why knock something if you haven't tried it?

Hunting animals is not kosher because the animal is not raised with the intent to be killed and treated well before doing so; as well as my vegan morals. The only time I view hunting to be okay is if it is for a population's traditional, native beliefs and practices. They must have some way of humanely killing the animal, and using it's body completely before discarding what cannot be used (which in theory is really nothing). I won't even touch leather because the thought of it creeps me out.

After driving them about a few times, they asked if they would ever be able to use the car for personal use. I trust them, so I immediately agreed to let them use the car whenever I wasn't if they asked. However, one roommate has taken to abusing it, often taking the car more than I do and keeping it for long periods of time while she's at her boyfriend's house. She typically asks, but the past few times its angered me when she uses the car for so long.

Then one night, they all kind of blew up on me for having my boyfriend over all the time but I did not even know it was an issue. It is frustrating because if they would have talked to me before and not all blow up at once this situation would have been handled better a long time ago.

Both sexes get the same opportunities. For any 'inequities' that exist, I think it is because men and women are genetically different and fit better into certain roles. Gender roles are good for our society. I feel like people are not willing to fight for themselves these days. We are weak and eager to complain.",7,2,6,21,female,,

Eventually, this person decided that it would be best if they were to move to a different hall and start all over. I am still nice to this person whenever I see them, but it will never be like how it was before.",7,2,4,19,female,,

1b,577,control,In this situation I was on a trip with my family to california. We had just spent several days at my aunts house with their family. I slept on the couch the majority of nights since it was easier for everyone that way. On the couch I got poor sleep because of the heat and general conditions. I don't complain often so I just went with it for the sake of it. My sister slept in the guest bedroom which was much nicer. Now we were staying with our friends at their cabin for a couple of nights. The first two nights I again slept in the worst bed that was uncomfortable and hot. It was the last night and I wanted to get good sleep for the first time in  a while so I asked my sister if we could switch beds just this once. She denied my request after I pleaded multiple times again informing her of the poor conditions I slept in before. Nonetheless she denied my request as she didnt want to sleep in that bed either. This greatly frustrated me since by her own logic of not wanting to sleep in that bed she was acting quite selfishly.,6,2,1,18,male,,
1b,593,control,The hunter gatherer argument started because someone claimed that hunter gatherer societies were communist and peaceful which meant that humans had the ability to have a peaceful communist society. I heavily disagreed with them on this claim and our argument started. I claimed that hunterer gatherer tribes were not really communist because they still had a chief or a leader who calls the shots. I also said that a leader will always form naturally in any group of humans. They kept repeating that if the group had some form of leader then it wasn't really a hunter gatherer society. I then said that the idea that hunter gatherers never killed other groups of humans was idiotic. Humans naturally compete with other groups of humans and this leads to conflict. I pointed humans would naturally fight each other if two groups moved into a region that wa abundant in resources and they didn't want to share. They said the hunter gatherers wouldn't stop in a region and just move on. I responded by saing hunter gatherers would stop hunt and gather and live in an area and move on when all the resources had been mostly used up and move on. I also said who would decide which group could stay and which had to leave and I said this was another source of conflict.,7,1,7,18,male,,

To make herself look better she threw me and my three other best friends under the bus. What she told to the school was not true and we were now getting in trouble for something she did. She then went on to dislike all of us because we told the school that we were not involved. To make matters worse she decided to disclose a lot of personal information to many peers and family members. We went on to no longer be friends or really talk. We were all very hurt and betrayed by this situation.,7,1,4,18,female,,

At first I did not know what to do so I made him stand in the corner for 3 minuities. He is 6 years old and knows better than to tear up his room. He cried in the corner for all the 4 minutes he was in the corner and said he was sorry. Although he was crying that he was sorry I still made him stand in the corner to teach him a lesson.

1b,629,control,My friend has the habit of ghosting people if he simply doesn't want to deal with a problem. He decided to ghost someone for various reasons and we got in an argument about it since I'm very against this method. I was actually under the understanding that he wouldn't be doing this again after he had done it to someone recently who had called him out for it. This wasn't a simple conflict that was resolved with one conversation because the first one didn't sink in. The extra problem with him ghosting this particular person was that we worked in close proximity to them making it difficult to create distance without it being obvious. I could tell the effects of the ghosting were not received well and I happen to know the feeling so I got on his case about it. He tried to explain it to me of why he did it and we had a huge argument about it. I think that he had valid reasons to want to break ties but I still don't agree with the manner in which he did it. It wasn't hard for me to see his POV since the person had done a few things but it was simply that I thought my friend was finally moving on from solving his problems in a not so productive way. I'm not sure if he's still actually communicating with them but he did have a talk with them at some point so he understood why ghosting them wasn't okay eventually.,6,3,6,19,female,,

They mentioned this fear to Person 2 and 3 in the house. After a while, they also told 2 and 3 they would avoid an uncomfortable situation by cancelling the extraneous sessions over email, rather than face to face. However, 2 and 3 felt like 1 was just avoiding their social anxiety tendencies, and would be better pushing themselves. They pushed 1 to rethink their decision for quite a while, saying that if 1 put themselves in more socially uncomfortable situations often, they would have less trouble doing so. 1 was offended because they felt like it wasn't 2 and 3's place to comment on how they dealt with their mental health issues.",7,1,3,19,female,,

As a third-party observer, I would have seen me trying to tell my friend that it's important to vote and exercise that right.

Then, I would see me respond with """"that's a horrible excuse not to vote, your parents are setting a bad example."""" I would also say """"you rarely ever called for jury duty, so that's not a good excuse either.""""

Said individual is acting appropriately as they are deeply hurt by what was said. What was posted on social media by the group was completely uncalled for and just added more issues. And then for them to not be apologetic in anyway is disgusting. They were not very good friends for the individual. It was the best choice for the individual to leave the group for good because they were harmful to their mental health. It doesnt make any sense that they thought that it was okay to do that.

It smelt terrible as it was and he wanted to let the smell spread and get worse before cleaning it up.

1b,374,as3party,There was a party to attend over this weekend. But the rules were Johnny had to finish both chores and homework before going which seem valid. I think Johnny not doing the homework when is was assigned was a poor choice and caused him problems later. Even though he was able to finish half the load and maybe tried to get to go with half of it not done using his reason was just a hope. I can understand where the mother was coming from because I feel like any parent would usually have that in mind finish your responsibilities first. On the other hand though I can see how Johnny did have a point with him having more time to do the homework since he had a later due date. In all I think the mother was just keeping her word so that he knows he can be pulling this stuff constantly. In regards of the scenario though I think Johnny should have just done his homework in a more effective manner which could have lead to a different outcome. As for the mother I think she did the right thing and overall it would be a learning lesson for Johnny on time management and procrastination.,5,5,3,18,male,,

The other claimed that hunter gatherers were not peaceful and that they had leaders due to human nature. The person for hunter gatherers being peaceful seemed to not know of human conflicts throughout history. It seems like they thought at a certain point humans were completely peaceful and never fought until capitalism was made. The one against hunter gatherers being peaceful was relying more on observation from throughout all of history and then came to a conclusion about the nature of hunter gatherer tribes. The one for hunter gatherer's being peaceful seemed to want to blame all the evil in the world on capitalism. They seem to not be able to realize that conflict is natural. They based their argument more on feelings then facts. They tried to take something from history and use it to support their current politcal views.,4,4,7,18,male,,

As someone who has both studied psychology and has been diagnosed with two mental illnesses, I attempted to explain to him the reality of mental illness. While I tried to understand his position, he did not do the same for me. Ben continued to say that I was wrong. He said that people with depression should just choose to get over themselves and stop taking about it. When I explained that I was happy that he could say this because it meant that he has not yet felt the pain of depression or other mental illnesses, he did not listen or sympathize with me. This argument was difficult to hear as I have suffered from mental illnesses. If he had taken my point of view into account, I would have felt much better and more heard. Sympathy in the case of discussion is always important and something he lacked in this case.",6,1,5,19,female,,

This was typically because we would have an argument or a disagreement. I think that when they ignore me, I tend to ignore them back when they finally respond. This is not a healthy way to deal with the problem, but more of just an emotional response that would display when treated in such a way. Another reason for fights that have been revolved around ignoring each other is because of miscommunication. There has been multiple misunderstandings which resulted in each other ignoring one another for the day.",5,4,3,20,male,,

I argued that if you began working and decided you did not like your job, that you could either go back to school for a graduate degree or attempt to get experience in a different field, but at least you would have the financial capacity to consider it as an option. He argued that someone can get stuck in a job that they hate or are not interested in. A friend of his thinks it is scary to decide on one area to go to school in that will be your career for the rest of your life, and he agreed. He thought that it was more important to get real life job experience than to have a degree, and that the cost of an undergrad degree in the U.S. is enough of a reason to not start studying something you aren't sure you love or if it will make you money in the long run. He argued that getting a license, such as a real estate license, is more valuable in the long run then school. I do not agree, as I think that completing your degree at least through the undergrad level (if you have the means to) provides a solid base of education that many people in this country lack.

My family member said that they agreed but worried that it didn't make a difference in the peer's actions. I care a lot about social issues and civil rights, so I reiterated how important it is to do so anyway and talked about privilege and discrimination for a moment. My family members thought I was saying that they hadn't stuck up for marginalized groups when they had. It was a misunderstanding where we basically agreed but they thought that I thought they hadn't spoken up to their friend, and thought that by elaborating on my opinion, I was attacking them and their character. I cried because I had not said anything bad about them, I had only expressed (in agreement with their points) the importance of what I thought, and it had been received as criticism when it was really an agreement. I felt hurt that the family member had assumed I was attacking them when all I had done in my eyes was continue adding to the conversation in a respectful way.

Then even if they do have the baby, they might've not been a responsible character, so now we have yet another neglected child in the world.

In her book Writing Fiction, Janet Burroway says that, in literature, â€œonly trouble is interesting.â€ Itâ€™s a bit ironic that in real life, we resist trouble; we shy away from conflict.

Yet on night before he left he was acting so weird I chose not to say goodbye to him which made him get mad and he was confused as to what he did wrong. The next day, I found out from one of his friends that he had kissed that girl a few weeks prior. I texted him and was very upset and told him it was disrespectful. He never responded to my text. I think he is embarrassed that I found and did not know how to respond.

The following morning I decided it would be in both of our best interests if we spoke about boundaries. Unfortunately, at first he saw this as attack on his character and felt bad for making me feel upset. I think me speaking with him about this was seen as a direct attack on his character- he genuinely felt bad he hurt my feelings.

I was also saddened by the fact that she didn't seem to think it was a big deal. If I were to reflect on how I think my friend thought and felt about this situation, I would imagine she thought felt sorry about it but didn't view it as a big deal. I imagine she probably thought that she should try to still make it but ultimately decided not to because of her busy schedule. My friend also doesn't place as much value on outings such as this as I do because to her it doesn't hold as much significance. People communicate value in relationships and loyalty in different ways and in this situation, she didn't view that in the same way that I do.

They believe that if they haven't been diagnosed with COVID despite being near it then they must be immune to it so therefore do not need the vaccine.

My brother's position was that speeding isn't even that dangerous, and that speed traps only exist to make the department more money through fines. It was a reasonable beginning to a normal debate, but it escalated. I told him that it shouldn't really matter what the motive is--he should be obeying the speed limit at all times, because that's the law.

Without informing me, the same director cuts the funding for this project in January of the next year, as part of a budget reduction requirement. I find out the funding was cut in March of that year, when I submit the invoice from the client to the director's department for payment. We are one of over two hundred suppliers participating in the annual marketing project (yearly print catalog), where the client has already spent the money and asks for payment when the project is complete. We owe them over $75,000, too large an amount for me , or my manager, or my manager's manager to cover unexpectedly. I saved the September emails from the director outlining the agreement to fund this program. I now have to negotiate for the money to pay this invoice by combining funds from who-ever I can scrape them up from. The Director's stance is there is no money in the budget, my director's stance is there is no money in our budget, and my position is we owe the client the money we committed to. The marketing director has the discretion to evaluate returns from other projects, reduce or cut them, plus a certain amount of discretionary room in the budget. Managers are incentivized to come in under budget, so I believe this director sees this as a zero-sum game.

When I was about 17-18 I had a brief romance with a girl who was deeply troubled for a number of reasons. She struggled with addiction and PTSD, and I was dealing with traumas of my own. Sadly I made the choice to end things because I thought I was a bad influence on her, enabling her self destructive vices. Eventually she ended up with my brother for a time, who also struggled with addictions but had no qualms about enabling hers, in stark contrast to myself. This naturally blew up into a catastrophic conflict amongst the three of us. Ultimately this girl nearly killed herself at our home (my brother's and mine, that is). I wound up covered in her blood and watching an ambulance take her away after finding her having slit her wrist. The very same night I developed an intestinal blockage due to the stress of the situation as well as my underlying condition (Crohn's Disease), and ended up in the hospital as well. My brother and I barely spoke for years following that incident. I left home and went as far away as possible. It wasn't merely a simple case of my asshole brother stealing my girl. It was that she was someone I cared enough about that I left her because I honestly believed she'd be better off, and in every way I could've been bad for her he was magnitudes worse. It made me hate him like I'd never felt before. Seething hatred the likes of which I couldn't get a grip on. I never blamed her, though she thought I did for years. We talked it out eventually, she and I, but my brother and I still have a ways to go. I don't know I'll ever fully let go of my anger towards him. Anyway, that was a bit much, yeah?

During our chat, the friend mentioned that he was having issues with his employer/supervisor.  When pressed for additional information, it came to light that the probable main cause of his dissatisfaction with his supervisor was because she was a woman.  He felt disrespected whenever she was dissatisfied with or chided him on his work.  Both my brother-in-law and I were united in our perspective that this was not right, and told him so.  However, while the friend listened to my brother-in-law's response attentively, he was quick to dismiss mine.  It was clear to me that he did not respect my viewpoints in the same manner as my brother-in-law's.  I was left with a feeling of frustration and annoyance that he had such a narrow viewpoint on respecting others.  I have yet to meet with this person in a private setting since, but I believe he felt justified in his views at the time.

She asked me to just wash my dishes as I use them so dishes don't pile up (she does this with most of her dishes). I felt that was fair, but was a little surprised to get an essential flat """"no"""" to my question and I was kind of cranky about it. I felt guilty for asking her to do my dishes and also frustrated she wouldn't entertain the possibility. We resolved it more or less.

I was not included in the decision for her to leave her work and become a stay at home mom.  The decision was made by her and her mother.  As our children became older and entered school full time, I constantly begged, pleaded and even demanded that she get something as simple as a part time job just to help out financially as we were falling deeper and deeper into debt.  She refused, often citing that her parents managed so that her mom could be a stay at home mom, and we should be able to also.  No mater what I did or said, I could never get through to her and get her to realize the amount of stress and frustration I had with her, and the building contempt I had for her that eventually led to situations that led to our divorce.  During 3 years of back and forth attempts at reconciliation which included marriage counseling, she started to realize how much conflict her choosing to exclude me from the decision initially and her continued refusal to listen to me had caused.  It still took her almost the full 3 years to finally get a job, but by that point we were divorcing.  Having talked with her since, she now fully realizes and understands how what she assumed to be minor disagreements or her thinking I was being irrational lead to major breakdowns in our relationship.

I raised my voice at him about how disrespectful and hurtful all of that was.  The next week, he drunkenly said something else hurtful about her that I care not to repeat.  I did a favor for him and he cooked me dinner as a thank you...and then proceeded to text with her while we were hanging out.  I told him that was it, that was done being hurt by him and haven't spoken to him since even though he has reached out to apologize.  I don't think he feels genuinely sorry.  I think he knows he fucked up and can't get me to do him favors anymore.",7,1,2,37,female,White,

1c,349,pt,"I had conflict with my dentist a while back. I had a crown that he did that was wiggly and not fitting right. I complained about it and could feel it moving slightly when I pressed with my tongue. He said he couldn't see it moving. I said well I can feel it and it's not right. He refused to believe me so I left and was so mad. A few weeks later it got so loose that there was no way he couldn't tell so I went back. He didn't say anything about not believing me before, but said he'd go ahead and fix it. A few weeks later my new crown came in and he was grinding a side of it down to fit perfectly but he ground it too much and I could see part of my tooth at the bottom when he put it on. I said I didn't think he fit correctly. He said the crown is fine, it must've been my gums that """"dropped"""" lower when he put it on. So his """"fix"""" for that was to take his sharp tool and rough up my gums to stimulate them to bleed and rise up to fill the gap. I left there mad again, but he made me feel like I was the problem. A couple weeks later I went back because of course the gap was still there. He sighed and rolled his eyes at me and took filling material to fill in the gap next to the crown.  I still didn't think that was a good solution and questioned it, but he was getting agitated and kept sighing. A couple weeks later his patch of filling material fell off and I was too dejected about the whole thing to go back. I just let that crown be, with the small gap by my gums. About 2 years later that crown was again loose because of his shoddy work and I had another dentist check it out. He pulled it off and my tooth was completely rotten underneath. I ended up having to go through the process of getting a bone graft and tooth implant which was around $5,000. I never contacted that bad dentist again but I have a lot of anger about him still. I'm sure I was just another patient and an annoyance to him. As long as he got paid by insurance he didn't care about the person in his chair.",7,1,3,47,female,White,

1c,351,pt,"I have an ongoing conflict with my significant other in which I addressed the fact that he does not contribute to the household chores as much as I do, although he states that he will. I believe that he only says that he will help with future chores to temporarily appease me. The only reason that I have not taken additional action is because he was raised in a household where his only obligation was to perform well in school. He was not required to help his family with cleaning or cooking, so when I would ask him, for example, to do the dishes, he would take a long time to complete the task. We are both studying for a major board examination at present. I decided to take on the household duties as I am much more efficient than my significant other. However, I have advised him that after our exam, I expect him to contribute more to helping with chores, regardless of how long it takes him to complete. He has agreed to this suggestion because he can sense the frustration that I feel at having to do everything on my own. I think that my significant other feels that I would be better at some tasks, such as cooking, than him and thinks that I would be a better fit to do those tasks all the time. I also believe that he does not think this is as big of an issue in our relationship than I believe it is, and that is why he has not taken any serious action. I also believe that he thinks that I would not end our relationship over such an issue, even though I address it nearly every day. I think he believes that he has not done anything wrong, and that if I were to end the relationship over such an issue, that I would be in the wrong.",7,1,7,26,female,Asian,

1c,356,pt,"I got into an argument with mom about support for trans people. We were in the car and she was driving, and I think the conversation started because she mentioned something about one of my friends from college who is trans. I then mentioned that my ex recently came out as trans, and my mom started talking about how she thinks all these young people are being mislead into thinking they're trans when they're really not. She also was trying to say that doctors are getting threatened that they'll lose their licenses if they don't put kids on puberty blockers, but also that people can't actually be trans if they don't know it from a super early age. All of these points made me really angry, because they're all based on misinformation and they're harmful to trans people. I tried to refute my mom's points bu she would always say that I didn't know what I was talking about because I'm younger than her. The argument lasted probably 45 minutes to an hour. I don't think I was able to change my mom's mind that much, but I did give her sources that backed up my points which I think she read after the argument. I was more heated in that argument than I had been in almost any other argument, partly because I couldn't leave the situation (we were in the car) and her refutations of my points weren't actually based on anything relevant. I think my mom felt really frustrated by the conflict too. She probably threatened, because my arguments threatened her current worldview, and she didn't want to have to change that. I still get a bit upset when I think about this conflict, but I doubt my mom thinks about it that much anymore. I think she thinks I'm the one who is misinformed about this topic, especially because she told me I was """"too open-minded"""" about stuff related to gender identity.",7,3,3,24,female,White,

They thought I was over reacting because they felt the task could be completed in a few minutes. The task took much longer for me as an individual, so I did not know that they could complete it so fast. They likely felt frusterated that I let my stress get the better of me and did not calm down and think rationally before talking with them. I walked away for a minute to calm down so I did not escalate the situation further. When I came back, we had a calm discussion, even though both of our feelings were hurt.

I said that sure, there is bound to be some Trump supporters that are racists, some that are sexist, or some that are ignorant, but I personally know a Trump supporter who is the kindest, unbiased woman I have ever met.

We had never really discussed politics before so I'm sure it was a bit of a surprise to her that I was not one the same page as her.

I understand where both of us were coming from now and it was obviously a very tough and difficult situation.,2,6,6,23,female,"Asian,White",
1c,385,pt,"About 3 years ago, me and my sister got into an argument about clothes, specifically over one shirt. Basically, my brothers girlfriend gave us some clothes to look through. There was one shirt that I absolutely loved, but my little sister has grabbed it first. I would ask to borrow it quite frequently, 2 to 3 times a month. After about 3 months, she told me that she would not let me borrow it anymore. When I pressed her about it, she told me that """"my boobs were too big and would stretch it out"""". I was very upset about that and decided to be very passive aggressive. I did not let her borrow clothes for many months after that. Looking back, she probably just wanted me to stop borrowing her shirt so often. We have both moved on from the situation, she even gave me the shirt a few months back because she did not want it anymore. I don't think either of us have any bad feelings about it.",3,5,3,18,female,White,
1c,386,pt,"I had started to grow out of my old friend group. This was because one of my ex-friends was consistently bullying me. I was fed up with being treated like nothing and none of my other friends doing anything to help me, so I stopped being near them. It seems like they took my leave to offense, because they started giving attitude towards me. They continued to talk about me behind my back even though I would not even do anything. We continued to ignore each other for the rest of the school year. At the end of the year, we were forced to communicate. It was clear that they did not want to be near me or talk to me at all. I felt that they thought that I betrayed them for making an abrupt leave. They seemed to not want anything to do with me any longer.",6,2,5,19,female,Asian,
1c,387,pt,"My grandmother does not like other people messing with her items. However, she always leaves a mess and doesn't clean up after herself. To prevent this, I would clean up her things without throwing away important things of hers. I understand that she might be worried that I will misplace something that is hers, but she becomes unreasonably angry. I try to compromise with her by telling her to move her trash to one place for me to clean. She still doesn't like that idea because she said that she could do it herself. She likes independence but that is difficult when the trash piles up too much. Our arguments don't result in anything because she refuses to acknowledge her messy habits. For now, I am only going to clean what she tells me to. She seems to prefer that much more.",7,1,2,21,female,Asian,
1c,388,pt,"I didnt invite my """"best friend"""" to my wedding. I felt she was not a very good friend at the time and we'd been growing apart. As soon as I got engaged she tried to start planning everything. I ended up getting married without ever telling her. She found out because our wedding was broadcast online and a friend of my husband's mentioned it online. She was livid, of course. She was very upset that I'd lied, which is completely understandable. I avoid conflict when possible and I felt like the easiest way would just be to tell her no wedding happened instead of telling her yes, we had a huge beautiful wedding, she just wasn't invited. I know she was very angry and hurt. I'm not sure if she is still mad as it's been over ten years.",2,5,5,38,female,Other,
1c,389,pt,"My boyfriend does not like that I don't like taking pictures. I have very low self esteem and if I take a photo or have a photo taken of me all I do is pick apart everything I dislike about myself.

1c,390,pt,"I've had an argument with someone regarding the validity of my opinion about the death penalty. I believe that living in prison with no chance of parole for life is worse than being executed. Her stance was that death was worse than life without parole. Her opinion likely comes from her inside knowledge of the prison system as an employee. We are both passionate people who have a tendency to get aggressive in an argument. Neither of us will concede, which we likely subconsciously knew before engaging in the argument. However, there is always an underlying hope the other can at least see our point of view if not change their minds. I get angry when I feel I am not listened to. She gets angry when she feels she is being interrupted or told her opinion is wrong. Most of our conflicts have the same hallmark responses.",5,3,5,21,female,White,
1c,391,pt,"I am very open about sharing all my clothes with my roommate and told her she can take anything from me any time. But when I take something of hers to wear, she gets mad. One day when I did, she got mad at me and told me I couldn't borrow anything from her again. I could only look at her closet when she was there to watch me. I understand that she was upset that I was taking her clothes, but I did not understand why it was such a big deal to her. I respected her request and didn't take anything from her in the future without her explicit permission. I think I learned that everyone doesn't have the same mindset as I do about everything. So, I always need to take other people's feelings into consideration before I made decisions involving them.",6,3,5,21,female,White,

They didn't tell me the other bathroom wasn't available, so I didn't see the need to rush. Because of that, I took my time. It was only after I got out of the shower that they told me the other bathroom was also occupied. They thought I was the only one in the wrong. After I explained my side and then apologized, they seemed to understand and accepted my apology. They stopped being mad about it only once I apologized, though. They didn't care anymore after that same day, despite being really made about it at first. I highly doubt they care about it at all anymore, since that was a while ago.",3,3,6,18,male,Hispanic/Latinx,

1c,394,pt,"I felt as though my mom wasn't showing me enough attention and instead was giving her boyfriend  most of her time and energy. I felt very hurt and would try to talk to her about it. I understand that I was dramatic about it, but it got to a point where I felt like she just didn't care anymore. I think she felt bad about it and acknowledged that she hadn't spent much time with me. But I think she also wanted to just live her own life and escape a bit. We communicated and she expressed this to me. We worked it out in the end, but I think it was clear that I needed to get more of a life so that we each could have our own lives.",5,5,5,24,female,White,

He did not want to talk about it at all and said I was being dramatic and brushed my feelings to the side. I brought up the fact that when he came with my for my friends birthday party we got in a huge argument. I was enjoying myself and having a good time with my friends and then I sit next to him on the couch and he is showing me something on his phone. Well he got a snapchat from someone who I did not recognize the name and when he opened it was a completely naked girl sending him pictures. Obviously, I got up and we left the party immediately. As we are walking to my car, he is trying to explain to me that the girl was a """"bot"""". I have never heard of that before but I was furious and he was not worth my time or energy. I dropped him off and was yelling at how stupid it is that he tried to play the situation off. We had been dating for 3 years and I never get any """"bots"""" snapchat me.

She informed me that she was now dating a boy who lived on our floor as well. The 2 would spend their nights in each other's rooms every night and did everything together. Then they went long distance for Winter break, and during their first week long distance, she came to me for advice on breaking up with him, which she took, and then go back together with him a few hours later. They have now been together for over a year but have broken up at least 4 times in that time. Every time they break up, she copes using self harm. Once I found out she was doing that, I reported her so she could get professional help. She did not take the help and has not talked to me since.",6,2,4,19,female,White,
1c,398,pt,"I recently had a conflict with my boyfriend. He was talking really negatively about how he views the world and how nothing makes him happy. He claimed that he has no interests. This made me feel like I was unworthy and that I was not enough to make him happy. I got upset because I was realizing that we had some really different views on life. He said that he wasn't upset with me and that I shouldn't take it personally. I felt that he was being ungrateful for all of the effort I put into the relationship to try to make us both happy. He told me that he just needs me to let him be angry sometimes but I really struggle with that. After the fact, he said that he knows what he was doing was wrong. He acknowledged that what he was doing was hurting both of us. He definitely felt guilty about the whole situation but is still struggling to find happiness and fulfillment in his life.",5,3,6,21,female,"Hispanic/Latinx,White",
1c,399,pt,"The last conflict that I had with another person was with my mom after one of my sisters got attacked. My other sister called her to tell her but asked her not to reach out to the sister who got attacked for fear that she might say something wrong to make the sister who got attacked feel worse. When I talked to my mom about it she was a little bit upset and didn't understand why the sister who called won't want her to reach out. I tried to explain to her that it was because my mom tends to say the wrong thing and victim blame in situations like this, which she is semi-self-aware of. In this situation she insisted that she knew better than to say something critical but I told her that it wasn't a situation where we wanted to take any chances and just needed to focus on supporting my sister who was attacked as best as we could. I think that my mom felt rejected because she's a mom and she feels like it's her job to take care of us, but in this situation my sister didn't want her to step in. Not only did she feel like we were preventing her from mothering my sister, she also felt like we were saying she was a failure as a mother for the way that she has reacted to or supported us in our problems in the past. The thing is, that's kind of the truth, and it's difficult to explain that to her in a loving way when we know that she loves us deeply and only want to do right by us. In the end what helped the most was reminder her that we all just wanted to do the very best we could for my sister and she was willing to do what we thought was best to keep the peace. I think that now we are all over it and just glad that my sister is getting better.",6,5,6,20,female,White,
1c,400,pt,My conflict with my partner resulted in a serious divorce attempt which lasted for several months before we were able to settle our differences. My partner was caught cheating by my sister and I confronted him about it with evidence yet he kept on denying it. I was furious because I felt hurt. I threatened to separate with him and to sieze his house keys. I was very furious because I hate cheats. However he came back to his right senses and started to smoothen our relationship.

As my husband and I grew closer, she started to look at everything as a betrayal. She thought we were doing sneaky things. I think because she didn't have a good support system, she felt like she was losing everyone. Outside influence also gave her a bad impression of us. I tried to reach out to her, but she didn't want anything to do with me. I know she felt hurt and sad, but she was not open to hearing anyone else's side of the story.

We talked every single day when we were at the same school and over summer we kept up with our communication pretty well. When I got back to school, however, it was much harder to stay in contact. I got busy with my schedule between classes and practices and it ended up making her feel like effort was not being reciprocated.

1c,403,pt,"I have a work colleague that is a very problematic person. We became friends for some time outside of work, but he continued to be problematic. He would make fun of people almost directly to their face, he was rude to servers and store employees. But, he was funny in a certain way, so we were sort of friends. Then one day when we were out to a restaurant he began to put down and make fun of other colleagues. I told him politely that I don't like to talk about that kind of stuff, and if you make fun of them, you are in a way, making fun of me. He continued with another sentence or two along the same lines. I told him literally """"yellow light"""" warning, stop making fun of my colleagues in my presence or I'm going to leave. He made excuses that he was only  talking about them, not me. I insisted that I consider myself part of that same group, and if he puts them down, he is putting me down. He continued. I said """"that's it,"""" grabbed my belongings, stood up, and left the restaurant. He then began calling me, calling my husband to talk to me, having other friends call me, insisting that I call him back. That may have seemed like a small thing, but it was the straw that broke the camels back. He has tried on many, MANY occassions to reiniciate our friendship. I believe he thinks I am overreacting, and that I can't take a joke. But the reality for me is that I am an adult person, I can decide who my friends are. I am not obligated to be someone's friend. I have enough friends. I certainly don't need an inconsiderate and rude friend. He still invites me out and sends me long texts and """"I miss you"""" texts. No thanks. I don't need the trouble.

Saying all kinds of unnecessary things from nowhere, I was confused since it was supposed to be lighthearted but the chat blew up from there. I don't normally argue at all, but he doesn't know anything about boundaries and he thinks he's funny, but his jokes aren't even jokes. I stopped seeing them after a week just to do my own thing and after I came back to hangout, a friend asked him if he apologized because even he knew that I was upset. I'm just frustrated at how unfunny someone can be and it's hard to make them realize that fact :/. I can't even tell him anything personal otherwise he'd just use it to 'roast' me whenever he could.

I have expressed to my father that I don't have the time to help him, as I'm taking care of my young child, and will be enrolling in classes come fall.

I'm sure that he feels jilted and abandoned. This is a common issue in his relationships, but it is impossible for him to see it that way. It is a symptom of his borderline personality disorder.
